NNAAMMEE Hello
yes Hello Madam
well I &apos;m calling cause well I have a Navigo pass er .. Navigo so for the zones one and four and er .. actually I have been on sick leave since the first of December and I wanted to know if it was possible to suspend my subscription
but what kind of subcription do you have ? an Imagine R , an Integral
er .. no , no it &apos;s the ( ) , it &apos;s the Navigo pass that I recharge every month .
Ah ok so this month you have recharged it for the zones one to four and you are on sick leave
that &apos;s it
exactly
and you would like to know if
it &apos;s possible
yes
to do something about this subscription
dead on
ok so
it &apos;s that because
I &apos;m not going to use it until the end of the month so I will have used it only once in fact
Ah ok so I am going to see what you have to do to suspend your subscription Sir
yes
I &apos;m putting you
on hold for a moment please
ok
please
cheers
sir ,
yes
so here is what I &apos;ve got regarding refund conditions for a Navigo pass
yes
in your case it is refund for half the value when the customer has cancelled his subscription in the first ten days of the month . you should cancel your subscription and under the following circumstances : illness , redundancy or imposed change of workplace
yes
so in your case it is for sick leave
yes dead on
so in ( )
yes
at the same time , you will have to bring a sick leave certificate huh
ok
so now
you should go first to a station to cancel the pass
yes
huh and you will send it to the address I &apos;m going to give you Sir
right on
huh cause you &apos;re going to send euh the suspension of the subscription , the supporting documents so er regarding your sick leave
huh
and then an explanatory letter
ok
and you
must send all of it to the RATP
yes
refund services
yes
then to 54 quai de la Rapée
54 quai de la Rapée yes
yes under LAC , so it is spelt L A C
yes
and further on B for Bernard 03
yes
and the postal code now is 75599
Paris cedex 12
ok
huh
but so
if I have got it right , I must do all of this during the first ten days of the month , is that it ?
yes and it &apos;s true that we are the 12th of the month but do it anyhow because whatever happens you are not going to use this pass
no no
Absolutely not
no
hum because er .. the first thing you are going to be asked is the suspension with the supporting documents
ok
because it &apos;s the info I have regarding the non use of the Pass
hum
now
ok
you might as well ask and see what the customer service will reply
hum hum
if they say yes
in that case there won &apos;t be any problem and if they say no it will be because you have gone over the ten days and that is why you ought to send a wee explanatory letter explaining what has happened .

NNAAMMEE hello NNAAMMEE hello
yes hello sir
hello madam
I &apos;m calling cause I have called the lost and found
yes
and I was told to call you , we lost yesterday in the RER B
yes
which arrived at the Gare du Nord at 21.16
yes
a hanging bag er black with a suit inside
so it was on the RER B last night
at 21.16
ok a black hanging bag
with a men &apos;s grey suit inside
so a black hanging bag with a men &apos;s grey suit huh
hmm hmm
ok , very well , it was last night , I &apos;m going to check
ok
please hold on
yes , of course , thanks
please
yes
thanks for waiting
don &apos;t mention it
so I &apos;ve checked again huh on er .. you said the RER B
yes
yesterday
yes
unfortunately I haven &apos;t found a suit in a grey hanging bag huh I &apos;m going to see if since yesterday
no the hanging bag is black
the black hanging bag and grey suit , my mistake sorry
we don &apos;t give a damn but
I had well noted a black hanging bag and grey suit
yes
don &apos;t worry I have got it right
yes
er .. Because I have things but er .. I have a bag with clothes which has been brought back but it &apos;s a Celio bag with men &apos;s clothes huh it &apos;s
and it &apos;s not that
no it was brought back but was lost yesterday at er .. Robinson at 12.40 huh
oh no no
so it &apos;s obviously not that one
yes
er .. I have some things but they would more similar to papers , identity cards , keys and stuff like that
no
Anyway I &apos;m going to check between today and yesterday huh
hmm hmm
if I have anything
and so ..
the problem is that I have checked on the network if someone has bought back the hanging bag with the suit at a SNCF desk for instance because at the Gare du Nord you have
yes
the SNCF station so there it can be brought back , we don &apos;t keep anything as the SNCF hand over everything to Morillons street at the lost and found items of Paris
when you mention the SNCF , do you mean the station
yeah the big station yeah yeah yeah
the station , even there we have called and they haven &apos;t found anything
they have nothing
no
because no matter where the item is brought back , it will go back to Morillons street at the lost and found items of Paris .
yes
if it has been found by someone , get it ?
yes
huh I can &apos;t see why someone would keep a jacket once
yes yes yes
it &apos;s a matter of size , er ..
I would advise you to wait a few days and then call the lost and found items of Paris
ok
I &apos;m going to give you their number
please do
so er , do you a have a pen , paper ?
yes
so it &apos;s the 0821
yes
0
yes
25 25
ok
08 21 00 25 25
ok
so , I &apos;m just going to check something out
if you don &apos;t mind
yes
well I had something which was found but it was at Trinité no , it has nothing to do , huh , a walkman , with a short jacket yeah it &apos;s the only clothes huh so I have looked and even checked on the other underground lines
yes yes
if by any chance it could have been deposited elsewhere
humm humm
but no that &apos;s all I have
well , it &apos;s a pity ok thanks alot Madam
that &apos;s quite alright
thanks good bye
bye madam

go on the website and three trains out of four is written otherwise you can make a complaint
er to tell them that it &apos;s bollocks
Excuse me madam
but even even
oh I don &apos;t know , in the stations you continue to announce three trains out of four whereas anybody can see that there is only one out of four , and so that is why we can make no head or tail of what is going on , huh

where are you madam ?
&quot; er . ; I &apos;m going to leave from Denfert heading towards er .. the south &quot;
