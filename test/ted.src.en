And in Arizona , of course , everybody puts gravel down .
And below , you can see all these out yards , or temporary yards , where the colonies are brought in until February , and then they are shipped out to the almonds .
It is also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses or other flus , and so the question we are still struggling with , and the question that keeps us up at night , is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu , and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases ?
And we don &apos;t have the answer to that yet , and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out .
So I immediately called her up , of course .
So the first project we are going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride . Now this took place in January of 2002 .
We all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants , put them on and said , &quot; Thank you . That is exactly what I needed today , &quot; and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions .
Al Gore , eat your heart out .
Seek those sounds out ; they are good for you and so it this .
And while we &apos;ve never heard the sounds from space , we really should , in the next few years , start to turn up the volume on what is going on out there .
What Einstein did not realize was that , if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across , you would make a black hole , an object so dense that if light veered too close , it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe .
So now we are going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across .
It is a remarkably ambitious experiment , and it is going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up .
And if we pick it up , it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation , of our observable universe .
In a Wimbledon final match , these two guys fight it out .
You have to act it out .
And I started putting the first YouTube videos up just a supplement for my cousins -- something that might give them a refresher or something .
And as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up , something interesting happened -- actually a bunch of interesting things happened .
And so what I am showing you over here , these are actual exercises that I started writing for my cousins .
Do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out ?
I had to bring it in .
And you &apos;ll note there is no light coming from them right now , either because they are dead -- or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like .
But it was worth it , because we caught it in a special capture device , brought it up into the lab on the ship , and then everything on this fish lights up .
And you normally don &apos;t get to see this because we &apos;ve exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets .
I just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing .
But if we collect it very gently , and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock , it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume , changing color as it goes , from green to blue .
And I can &apos;t claim for sure that the optical source brought it in , because there is bait right there .
But through science , we do have a fairly good idea of what is going on down at the molecular scale .
And if we isolate just one chromosome , we are going to pull it out and have a look at its structure .
OK , George , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
The reason that they gave about American bombing wasn &apos;t all that far off .
In this rather long sort of marathon presentation , I &apos;ve tried to break it up into three parts : the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer and really address the qualities of the human interface .
So if I wanted to call my friend Peter Sprague on the phone , my secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk ,
and we fix them up , like Humpty-Dumpty all over again , and send them home , and hope -- we might hand them a brochure , maybe an interactive website -- that they do as asked and don &apos;t come back into the mainframe .
They fixed her back up . She was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living . They put her into the nursing home unit .
We are going to figure something out for the next 10 years , and try it .
Then I just pick things up .
So that is what I am here to tell you about : how we are going to fix a chicken .
I mean kids are studying this stuff and they &apos;ve got the word &quot; fluctus &quot; up there . That is wrong .
We &apos;ve got to change this stuff up fast .
I just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are , without heart and without love it is just -- it is all meaningless . And that , to me , is really beautiful .
Once again , Nicaragua let me down .
Once again , these guys rock it out .
And the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn &apos;t really work .
And that didn &apos;t work out well .
Hey , you can &apos;t make this up .
It is not a dinosaur ; it is a whale , animals as big as office buildings still swimming around out there in our ocean .
Of course , sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears , which , in my opinion , makes them much more interesting a superhero .
I couldn &apos;t fit them in .
Now , finning is the act of taking a shark , cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water .
There is nothing funny or entertaining about it , but I really wanted to take this issue on .
And you take the piece out into the daylight .
And you find other things , and you break that up , and you haul those away .
Now bring it out , bring it out . Anybody else ?
OK , you over there on the aisle . Would the four of you with calculators please bring out your calculators , then join me up on stage .
I won &apos;t even write these down -- I &apos;ll just call them out as they are called out to me .
Yell it out , what year ? Audience : 1959 .
Anyway , Chris , you can help me out here , if you wouldn &apos;t mind .
But I &apos;d like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation .
I am going to break the problem down into three parts .
Could somebody put this guy up ?
I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
So , I &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
If you look it up in the book , it is really 343 .
chasing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
If we &apos;ve got them wired up with an electroencephalogram , the right brain of each of them becomes attuned , so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we are beginning to get a handle on .
We are going to look at body play , which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity .
The players slowly explore the environment , and begin again to test things out .
And this gives us a leg up on adaptability .
Most of us work with groups , and I put this up because the d.school , the design school at Stanford , thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment , has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called &quot; From Play to Innovation . &quot; And you &apos;ll see this course is to investigate the human state of play , which is kind of like the polar bear-husky state and its importance to creative thinking :
Take the meeting off , and have peace of mind that you can come back to me .
Because when you put it on , you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting .
But when you take it off --
Well , let &apos;s round these kids up , put them in pens and make them play for months at a time ; they &apos;ll all be geniuses and go to Harvard .
And my job -- at that time I was a post-doctoral fellow , and I was really tasked with setting this up .
The dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing about .
If a computer speech recognition system is able to recognize what you are saying , then it spells it out .
This is a device which is intended to reduce the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials .
In Madrid , Maria Gonzalez is standing at the door , listening to her baby crying and crying , trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it .
We talk things over with our friends , we scour the Internet , we search through books . But still , even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon Recommends , it is still experts that we rely upon most -- especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters .
These are , of course , not the only insights I could share , but I hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them , why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision-making capabilities on .
You see , being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs , their equations , their forecasts , their prophecies , and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like : What are the assumptions that underpin this ?
The strategies that I have discussed this evening -- embracing dissent , taking experts on , democratizing expertise , rebellious strategies -- are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing , complex , difficult times .
Now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open -- yes , using experts to help us figure things out , for sure -- I don &apos;t want to completely do myself out of a job here -- but being aware of their limitations and , of course , also our own .
And a plate comes up , holds your battery , takes it out , puts it back in , and
Nobody wants to buy a minuses well when they buy a car .
An 80 cent gallon means , if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil , and we &apos;d let any oil company bring it out and refine it , they still can &apos;t compete with two cents a mile .
We then decided to scale it up .
As we stared scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S. ?
It becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out .
Then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 --
We go back down . It is going to go up and down .
And I know that there are , if I could put a little plug here , there are people in this audience easily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question , and I put the suggestion up -- for what it is worth .
We put together a program that would , one : get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in .
We didn &apos;t know we could pull it off ; it was very controversial .
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent .
So , NASA , at some point , did an experiment where they took images of Mars that they were mapping , and they said , instead of having three or four fully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time , let &apos;s break it up into small components , put it up on the Web , and see if people , using a very simple interface , will actually spend five minutes here , 10 minutes there , clicking . After six months , 85,000 people used this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in , which was , quote , &quot; practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained Ph.D. , &quot; once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average .
If you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium , which creates a vigorous immune response , they &apos;ve created a very powerful flu fighter .
Every year Africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food . Just add that up , all these leakages .
And without consulting me about it , it had edited them out .
I gave my speech , then went back out to the airport to fly back home .
And the same thing with the atmosphere : If you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball , you would get that little sphere of gas on the right .
But in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least 30 years , there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from , buying the government out from under us .
If we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up , we get a three-dimensional image .
It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech . Now go ahead and open it up .
You sir , come on up .
Come on up . Tell everybody your name .
So here , come on up to the front . All right , so now if you &apos;ll see here -- no , no , it is OK .
And you know , his son was mesmerized , because he would dunk it in the water , he would take it out and it was bone dry . A few weeks later , he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother &apos;s hair , and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair .
I mean , after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me .
As he said to me , that really pissed the French off .
I figured it out .
We went back out for the final tour of the farm , and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity .
I am on the plane and I am just tearing my hair out .
OK , I can see , if I found something , up , up , and they continue , up up up .
But today I am going to talk to you about something you can &apos;t see -- what is going on up in that little brain of hers .
The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what is going on up there is nothing short of rocket science .
This is the critical period for sound development , but what is going on up there ?
Whatever you put in front of them , they &apos;ll take statistics on .
The other founding members included Ahmed Ahmed , who is an Egyptian-American , who actually had the idea to go to the Middle East and try it out .
Then he opened it up . &quot; born in Iran ? Wait . &quot;
&quot; Gimme all your money , or I &apos;ll blow myself up . &quot;
All it takes in one person to mess it up . Like a couple months ago in Times Square in New York , there was this Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb .
And when you put your two year-old on a slide in the United States , they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide .
I was doing a show , and they said , &quot; We are going to send a driver to pick you up . &quot;
And when you give yourself over to that deception , it becomes magic .
When they opened this one up , they found its stomach was full of plastic .
If the Atlantic was about my inner journey , discovering my own capabilities , maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey , figuring out how I can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world , and to take some of those things that I &apos;ve learnt out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in .
You can talk about creationism -- which I think wouldn &apos;t go down well with this audience , at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it -- or you can talk about optimisations , spelled the British way , with an S , instead of a Z.
I don &apos;t remember , in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture , a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning , fire exiting , safety concerns and whether carpet burns .
And here comes dune-scape , coming up out of the courtyard , and there it is fully built .
And I went and put a little announcement up on our site , asking for people to join us in this enterprise .
I &apos;ve stitched Euclid &apos;s parallel postulate on to the surface .
In fact , some years ago , Bill Joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over , etc.
And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of , divided our lives up into lots of parts .
We divided our world up with lots of categories .
You can get it out .
SS : She is got the pedals down , but not the wheel .
After the earthquake , immediately , people all over the world , mappers who wanted to help , and could , looked at that imagery , built the map , quickly building it up .
I also want to wind this one up a bit . How can they communicate ?
Now , everyone was very excited to try it out .
So you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways and -- oh , and short steps ?
It was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move , that engineers knew nothing about .
You have to be careful where you put your feet down , don &apos;t you , because if you get it wrong , it just throws you off your feet .
Interviewer : So you &apos;ve got to put your feet out sideways .
and when I would go out and give a presentation , I would pass the list out in the audience . I wouldn &apos;t tell them what it was , but it was in alphabetical order ,
And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation .
But , you know , NASA screwed that up because they &apos;ve sent these robots and they &apos;ve landed it only in the deserts .
You can create one out of Legos . You know , you can do anything you want .
So , here we got the white area in the middle , and you can pick it up .
The goal is to get the red car out . It is a sliding block puzzle .
You are going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right .
Don &apos;t tell me not to cry , to calm it down , not to be so extreme , to be reasonable .
Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off ?
And so I finally got to this city , and I had done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold -- but when I got there , I got to the palace of the chief , and my French is not very good ; I said something like , &quot; I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof . &quot; But he was really cool about it , and he took me up there , and we talked about fractals .
I didn &apos;t put his name up here -- my colleague , Kerry , in Kenya , has come up with this great idea for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure , because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village , it doesn &apos;t quite fit .
And if we could figure that out , how can we implement those designs ?
If you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to Berkeley , come to my lab and we &apos;ll figure this out . Okay , send them to Berkeley because that is the next thing I want to do . Here is the gecko mill .
And if you blow those up , they have these little structures on the end .
And my daughter , who is three , when I dropped her off at preschool , did that whole hugging-the-leg , crying , &quot; Mommy , don &apos;t get on the plane &quot; thing .
I learnt that I need to keep my hand up .
And I put my hand down , and I noticed all the women put their hand down ,
Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more ?
They divided them up into two groups .
The high-fear group , they laid it on really thick .
It is very difficult to line things up so neatly .
So it spells those out in very clean terms ,
So that is what I want to walk you through .
even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock , set it up in 15 minutes .
He tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank , turns them down , and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank -- clucking , gossipping as chickens will --
So the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they are pushing around the manure to get at the grubs , and in the process they are spreading the manure out .
But partly , we want to make the world a better place , and so one thing that we are embarking upon is the Google Foundation , and we are in the process of setting that up .
So this is how -- we just deployed it -- we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service , and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out .
And in News &apos;case , you know , they had a couple of people working on it for a while , and then more and more people started using it , and then we put it out on the Internet , and more and more people started using it .
in any case , we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them , that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be .
And this was kind of a surprise to me , but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head , which you did by writing them down , that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources .
and they are noisy , so people shut them off .
And so basically , he thought he was dealing with something smart , and of course , you know , we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out ,
Come here at a certain time , get your drinks half off .
So they whip it out . And you see men , they have that black card .
because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses .
We teamed designers and investment experts up with 11 water organizations across India .
In one study , which we ran in Japantown , San Francisco , we brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American children into the laboratory , and we divided them up into three groups .
No matter where we are from and what your narrative is , we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do , and what it can represent . And this does not lead to a paralyzing moral relativism .
So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory , and I stripped the labels off .
But it is this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing .
You had kind of have to take Century City out , but it could fit in there .
Jack Berry : boys and girls , I think you all know how to get your magic windows up on the set , you just get them out .
First of all , get your Winky Dink kits out .
Then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set , and rub it out from the center to the corners , like this .
Eventually hired myself out as a designer .
You can put them down , essentially out of the way .
Or you can pull them up where you want them .
Just relieving your arms with armrests takes 20 percent of that load off .
While you are sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five-footer , or you can adjust it for the six-foot-six guy --
You know , I haven &apos;t verified this , but it is the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension , because you &apos;d want to space them all out for everybody &apos;s sight lines .
And here we &apos;ve broken the 500 apartments up into small neighborhoods , and differentiated those neighborhoods .
What I &apos;d like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter , and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea .
One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism -- some that produce a lot of toxins , some that produce a little -- and take those strains and spew them out in different countries .
So , I don &apos;t really have time to talk about those things , but I did want to put them up there , just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we are confronted with .
If we know that we are going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water , then I think that we can say , let &apos;s push the effort into that aspect of the control , so that we can actually solve the problem , even though , if you just look at the frequency of infection , you would suggest that you can &apos;t solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply .
And we can use electrodes or antennas to pick that up and tell the arm to move .
So this is the first man that we tried it on .
So my colleague , Dr . Greg Dumanian , did the surgery . First , we cut away the nerve to his own muscle , then we took the arm nerves and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest and closed him up .
He feels light touch down to one gram of force .
And I was driving home from work , and a truck was coming the opposite direction , came over into my lane , ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off .
So for the simple little things like picking something up , I would have to bend my elbow , and then I would have to cocontract to get it to change modes .
I had to hook it up to a computer , so I couldn &apos;t just train it anywhere .
So if it stopped working , I just had to take it off .
And so you can see this current coming up -- in this case , the Humboldt Current -- that comes all the way out to the Galapagos islands ,
When we have extreme El Nino events , you see all this red , and you see no green out here around the Galapagos .
Some years , the cold water goes all the way up to Brazil , and other years , in these La Nina years , it doesn &apos;t.
We need to be able to get information out to the general public .
So if you are interested in cutting-edge science and smarter conservation , you should join with our 11 partners -- some of them here in this room , like the Nature Conservancy -- and look at this magazine because we need to get information out about conservation to the general public .
we let him in and he comes in here .
There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries , such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States , most countries vow to just sit it out , including American allies like Korea and Australia .
If you add it all up what do you get ?
So it can &apos;t turn the genes on .
If you knock them out completely , then you are very sick .
You add all this up together and of course people are apathetic .
Now I am not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining what is in our way .
Well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out .
In other words , men , you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department .
They dressed you up , they lined you up , and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye .
So I am obviously going to need fatten him up .
And like I said , we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up .
In the experiments I told you about , we have lifted the identity of the Critic , but we still have no idea how the Critic does its job .
That is Kellar Autumn , my former Ph.D. student , professor now at Lewis and Clark , literally giving his first-born child up for this test .
But she actually used these on smooth surfaces -- two of them -- to climb up , and pull herself up .
My colleagues actually went on to test this limitation , by increasing the moment of inertia of a student , so they had a tail , and running them through and obstacle course , and found a decrement in performance ,
And we ran it up a surface .
We &apos;ll blow the air up , we &apos;ll give it a landing target , a tree trunk , just outside the plexi-glass enclosure , and see what it does .
The nations that brought it up when we had the speeches of the national leaders -- it tended to be the leaders of the small island states , the low-lying island states .
Now , Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral .
That the place where , during an earthquake in 1954 , this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly , and it was lifted up about six to seven meters .
And we just count on down to the bottom .
It is about connecting people through film , getting these independent voices out there .
There is Just Vision , that are working with Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace , and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to Congress to show that it is a powerful tool to show that this is a woman who has had her daughter killed in an attack , and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this .
But if there is a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them either . That is true .
We pull them out , put them in the fridge , and they fall asleep .
We are not defined by our central properties , by the bits that make us up .
Let &apos;s pull the covers off .
It is a horrific story . Someone took a bottle of Tylenol , put poison in it , closed it up , put it back on the shelf .
I go home , I look it up .
But if you think about it , if you are a hospital , and you need to take a baby away from its mother , out of the room to run some tests , you better have some good security theater , or she is going to rip your arm off .
You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off .
And then you have to store them at about minus 20 degrees C -- that is about minus four Fahrenheit , I think -- with a very critically low moisture content .
Metamaterials , unfortunately -- A , it only works on microwave , and B , it doesn &apos;t work all that well yet .
and we just have to prop those up in the right way and get them to do the job .
Super Bowl . I heard it over here . It was the date of the Super Bowl .
It is not enough to simply write people off .
Incidentally , they did pull it off .
I want to show you the rest of this photograph , because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word &quot; compassion &quot; in our culture -- we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life , which is messy .
And do you really want to leave it up to chance ?
The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust .
So , it is really a rather lofty initiative , if you want to think that way , but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead , that was bold enough and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently .
So , we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down .
I think inside at some point , we put our heads down on the pillow and we go , &quot; There is got to be more to life than this . &quot;
The problem is most people never really think it through .
And God says , &quot; Throw it down . &quot;
And if you saw the movie , you know , he throws it down and it becomes a snake .
And then God says , &quot; Pick it up . &quot;
And he picks it back up again , and it becomes a staff again .
You are making a lot of money off that little ball .
The change is absolutely monumental , because it is not just opening it up , but it is opening it up to the rest of the world .
She is anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing -- stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what is going on out there .
And unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
This is a well-known phenomenon . You eat certain things , you produce a lot of gas . It may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process . If that is true , then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off , and it may not be to burn coal . It may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture .
As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time , what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure .
As I spent my week up in the Himalayas , I started to imagine what I call an emotional equation .
When you were younger , you cared about the whole world , and at some point somebody said you had to pick an issue , you had to boil your love down to an issue .
You &apos;ve got to shrink it down and be about one issue .
They had worn themselves out , beating themselves against the window , and , well , they were easy to capture . I took them outside and as I let them go , that split second , even though they were very tired , that second I let them go they hovered for a second , then zipped off into the distance .
On this next slide , is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure , because whether I give you a perfect Skycar , the perfect vehicle for use , it is going to have very little value to you unless you &apos;ve got a system to use it in .
So I thought I had better look it up first .
But who is going to want to plug them in ?
where people don &apos;t have to die of infections anymore if you can seal the thing up .
We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities , and that is how we are going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream .
You can see all types of resolution . From here , I can slowly pan the image over .
You would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch , a little gin -- particularly around 1650 -- and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day .
The problem is , if you buy a $ 40,000 incubator , and you send it off to a mid-sized village in Africa , it will work great for a year or two years , and then something will go wrong and it will break , and it will remain broken forever , because you don &apos;t have a whole system of spare parts , and you don &apos;t have the on-the-ground expertise to fix this $ 40,000 piece of equipment .
The other problem that people have is they like to condense their stories of innovation down to kind of shorter time frames .
It was right at 20 MHz , so you could pick it up really easily , because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax , basically .
30 years later , Ronald Reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform that anybody could kind of build upon and anybody could come along and build new technology that would create and innovate on top of this open platform , left it open for anyone to do pretty much anything they wanted with it .
And from then on , since I was now in this huge exciting world , I wanted to explore it all . I wanted it all at once , but knew I couldn &apos;t really get that .
It is different when a bacteria comes into the body -- that is a foreign object -- we want that out .
So , I was so disturbed by what I saw , and I was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards , that I decided I would take six months off .
And then , at night , about midnight , they turn the heat off in the hotel . So at about 1 a.m. , the whole room would be like 20 below zero , and I &apos;d get up .
So , I run over to Gene , and I wake him up , and I say , &quot; Gene , don &apos;t freak out , I think the hotel is on fire . &quot;
So , we are trying to get Natasha up , and we can &apos;t talk to her .
I didn &apos;t know who it was , I didn &apos;t know what they wanted , and Natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out .
And you &apos;ll find Madagascar , and you &apos;ll find a lot of African countries about as low as the rest of the world .
You can play a game and try and think of one I &apos;ve missed at , or try and boil it down to just four , but you &apos;ll lose .
It is mainly starch , and starch , when you break it down -- what is starch ? It is -- thank you -- sugar , yes .
And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot; So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
On the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
AG : Okay , he is got his experimental notebook out .
Boy : What is making this light up .
He told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
She says , &quot; All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder the faster I move it across the screen . &quot; And the technician &apos;s like , &quot; Ma &apos;am , you &apos;ve got the mouse up against the screen ? &quot;
It is not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices . They could have put them all out in view .
Microsoft &apos;s approach to simplicity tends to be : let &apos;s break it down ; let is just make it more steps . There are these &quot; wizards &quot; everywhere .
They are dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh , but they can &apos;t. They are locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis .
I made a fortune over at Pixar .
They conduct heat along their length but not across -- well , there is no width , but not in the other direction if you stack them up ; that is a property of carbon fiber also .
So if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on .
Doesn &apos;t it feel good to say it out loud ?
He uses tiny bottles , the glass is tinted , he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas .
There was one object that I could not get my hands on , and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc .
You break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities .
The 25 percent . This lights the brain up .
We can break things down into highly calibrated small tasks .
We roll 120-foot Spartan , i.e. our vision , up to our clients &apos;gates of Troy . And we don &apos;t understand why they won &apos;t let us in . Right ?
When you are on Broadway , you cannot tear the proscenium down .
In this case what we are doing is we are taking the orchestra floor , lifting it up , spinning it , changing the rake , taking it back to flat floor , changing the rake again . In essence , you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating , at will .
This building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out .
This is a project that scans the world is newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes , searching for occurrences of the phrases &quot; I feel &quot; and &quot; I am feeling . &quot; And when it finds one of those phrases , it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author .
So , the last thing we did , very quickly , is I took all those wish balloons -- there were 117 interviews , 117 wishes -- and I brought them up to a place called Dochula , which is a mountain pass in Bhutan , at 10,300 feet , one of the more sacred places in Bhutan .
And we re-inflated all of the balloons , put them up on a string , and hung them up there among the prayer flags .
So if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future , you can go check these out . Here are some images from that .
How do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost ? How do you do it ?
No matter how you do that , you are not going to start with a 100,000-dollar instrument and bring it down to no-cost . It isn &apos;t going to work .
the device filters out the blood cells , lets the serum go through , and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there .
It distributes itself out into these various wells or holes , and turns color ,
we spin it , and you get blood cells out . Terrific .
And we sat down , we did the physics of eggbeaters and self-aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing , sent it off to a journal .
And we sent it off , and by return mail it came back .
In doing so , we &apos;ve destroyed our credibility with the Security Council , which means it is very difficult to get a resolution on Syria , and we are setting ourselves up again for failure .
And so she must have taken the ferry over .
You notice that the coat she is carrying is too small for the child who is with her , and therefore , she started out the journey with two children , but dropped one off along the way .
I always begin with the pulse , then I examine the hands , then I look at the nail beds , then I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node , and I was into my ritual .
And as I wondered what he was up to , his stick fingers made their way up to his pajama shirt , fumbling with his buttons .
Whereas -- and it is true , scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter or something like that --
And , to his credit , Katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out .
You can open it up completely . It is waterproof .
The quick little diagram of it is , you are up here , and you are pushing it out to the world .
That instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them , that instead of being what I call a sheepwalker -- somebody who is half asleep , following instructions , keeping their head down , fitting in -- every once in a while someone stands up and says , &quot; not me . &quot;
And there was a drunk man on there , and he got up out of his seat two or three times , and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do . And he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by , and everybody was upset with him .
My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me not to take this trip out here to this -- to be here .
So I &apos;ve decided to get a grip and sort it out .
My wife , who is somewhere in the audience today , called me up at the office and said , &quot; Nigel , you need to pick our youngest son &quot; -- Harry -- &quot; up from school . &quot; Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening .
So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates .
I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe , and we shared a pizza for two , then walked down the hill to our home , and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas .
I then put him to bed , tucked him in , gave him a kiss on his forehead and said , &quot; Goodnight , mate , &quot; and walked out of his bedroom .
Cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don &apos;t absorb solar heat and pass it on to the building or atmosphere .
But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out .
They are so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests .
And I am going to take this blade of steel , and push it down through my body of blood and flesh , and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible .
That is what we are searching for -- when we are working our craft , we are really trying to find that truth out there .
And first of all , you have to go with me for a second , and say , you know , you could take the word &quot; love &quot; out of a lot of things in our society , put the word &quot; design &quot; in , and it still works , like this quote here , you know . It kind of works , you know ?
We haul their butts out in the snow , too . You want to know cars outside ?
We start out with 10 cars ; we narrow it down to five cars , down to three cars , down to two cars , down to one car , and I am in the middle of that killing , basically .
Well , this project , Deep Blue , put me in contact with my team in a way that I never expected , and I want to pass it on to you , because I want you to reflect on this , perhaps in your own relationships .
So my concept of what a design studio was probably -- I wasn &apos;t up to speed on where these guys were .
And every nursing shift we would throw this material out .
You might say , &quot; Well , maybe things just smoothed themselves out . &quot;
That is a wonderful insight , but it leaves something out .
Even if you left our galaxy out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies .
and this small system actually prints it out --
I took it very literally , and took my bike helmet , put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely .
And we are trying to figure that out , because it is an amazing capability .
We can run the score up against anybody , and then get our asses kicked in the second half -- what they call fourth generation warfare .
and then say in no uncertain terms , &quot; Please cut that out . &quot;
And if you can &apos;t find one you &apos;ve got to make one up .
One takes down networks , one puts them up .
Do we need a draft to pull this off ?
With their remaining funds , they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building .
As the senior officer approaches with a baton , Layma stands up with deliberation , reaches her arms up over her head , and begins , very slowly , to untie her headdress that covers her hair .
Today &apos;s biggest threat to the Ashaninka people and to Benki comes from illegal logging -- the people who come into the beautiful forest and cut down ancient mahogany trees , float them down the river to world markets .
Egos , systems of government -- figuring it out -- massive change .
But the good news is that we don &apos;t have to figure it out as we go along ; we have models , we have examples , like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan .
This is me testing it out .
Just to round it up -- this is the new Apple Power Music Stand .
It would be a great honor , a great compliment for me , if he hadn &apos;t decided to take all them off two hours before the opening .
The way we are going to do this is fly him in and drop him off .
So the scene : the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in .
How should we figure it out ?
I am going to find that out , and when I find that out , I am going to prevent a huge amount of damage that he could cause .
Now , you had a lot of power , and you got to beat people up -- you got a lot of prestige , a lot of respect .
But he hears some voices up in the stairwell , so he climbs up the stairwell .
And it actually was the right choice , probably , to try to make it out -- this way .
So it is a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street .
What I really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people &apos;s words . taking them off the dead , flat pages . bringing them to life , bringing them to light .
♫ Well , if no one ever marries me ♫ ♫ And I don &apos;t see why they should , ♫ ♫ Nurse says I am not pretty , ♫ ♫ And you know I am seldom good , seldom good -- ♫ ♫ Well , if no one ever marries me ♫ ♫ I shan &apos;t mind very much ; ♫ ♫ Buy a squirrel in a cage ♫ ♫ And a little rabbit-hutch . ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ I &apos;ll have a cottage near a wood ♫ ♫ And a pony all my own ♫ ♫ A little lamb quite clean and tame ♫ ♫ That I can take to town . ♫ ♫ And when I am really getting old -- ♫ ♫ And 28 or nine -- ♫ ♫ Buy myself a little orphan girl ♫ ♫ And bring her up as mine . ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ Well , if no one marries me ♫ ♫ marries me ♫ ♫ Well , if no one marries me ♫ ♫ marries me ♫ ♫ Well , if no one marries me ♫ Thank you .
Just bring it down a little .
♫ I want to thank you , thank you ♫ ♫ I want to thank you ♫ ♫ Ooh hoo ♫ ♫ Ooh hoo ♫ ♫ Ooh hoo ♫ ♫ Ooh hoo ♫ Let &apos;s bring it down .
Gradually , bringing it down , bringing it down . ♫ I want to thank you , thank you ♫ Finger popping , ain &apos;t no stopping .
So as a result , we never throw anything out .
If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
So this is us climbing onto the trees and putting it up over the Sayan Valley in Indonesia .
I &apos;ll figure something out .
We stir this in until it is completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath .
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet .
Then they ship them off , hundreds of miles away to hard-line schools that run along the Taliban agenda .
He blew himself up , killing six .
Because we are taking this data in 3D form , slicing it up before it gets past the machine , we can actually create structures that are more intricate than any other manufacturing technology -- or , in fact , are impossible to build in any other way .
So we can run this through to something like prosthetics , which is highly specialized to an individual &apos;s handicap .
And I was building this Stirling engine over on the lathe , and all the biker guys -- motorcycle guys -- came over and said , &quot; You are building a bong , aren &apos;t you ? &quot;
So we created this genetic algorithm to try this out , we made a model in XL of a multi-surface reflector , and an amazing thing evolved , literally evolved , from trying a billion cycles , a billion different attempts , with a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light , from the most angles , over a day , from the sun .
Take it off the flame and pour water on it , or let it cool down , the piston moves down .
You move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you are only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end , down to the hot end and up to the cold end .
That allows you to get the efficiency up from a hundredth of a percent to about two percent .
So you are reusing your energy five or six times , and that brings the efficiency up between 30 and 40 percent
It is a little known , but brilliant , genius invention of Robert Stirling that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical -- like I found out when I made the real simple version in high school -- to very potentially possible , once you get the efficiency up , if you can design this to be low enough cost .
The way the unit works is , when the sun comes out the engine will start and you get power out here .
But you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher because some of the heat that you would normally be rejecting , you can now use as useful energy , whether it is for a pool or hot water .
If you get it down below five years then it becomes almost a no-brainer because the interest to own it -- someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money , basically from day one .
And we don &apos;t have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are , I think .
We blow it up and look at the pieces .
But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought , this book is amazing .
TC : My relationship to this concept of heart-to-heart connection , or mind-to-mind connection , is an interesting one , because , as a spiritual leader , I am always attempting to open my heart to others and offer myself up for heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind connections in a genuine way with other people , but at the same time , I &apos;ve always been advised that I need to emphasize intelligence over the heart-to-heart connections , because , being someone in a position like mine , if I don &apos;t rely primarily on intelligence , then something dangerous may happen to me .
You look at it and you see it has four legs , the machine doesn &apos;t know if it is a snake , if it is a tree , it doesn &apos;t have any idea what it looks like , but it is going to try to find that out .
What happens if you don &apos;t reward them for anything , you just throw them in ?
And what I &apos;d like to do is take you up to the canopy , not by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses , but rather showing you a very short clip from a National Geographic film called &quot; heroes of the High Frontier . &quot;
What we do , my students in my lab and I , is we buy barbies from Goodwill and Value Village , we dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses and we send her out with a canopy handbook .
If you look at this diagram of a coral reef , we know a lot about that part up near the top , and the reason we know so much about it is scuba divers can very easily go down there and access it .
Now , submersibles are great , wonderful things , but if you are going to spend 30,000 dollars a day to use one of these things , and it is capable of going 2,000 feet , you are sure not going to go farting around up here in a couple of hundred feet , you are going to go way , way , way , down deep .
Over time , those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues and start to fill you up .
No , it only takes a couple of minutes to get all the way down to three or four hundred feet , which is where we are aiming for .
sharks are actually not very dangerous animals and that is why we weren &apos;t worried much , why we were joking around down there .
So sharks aren &apos;t quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be .
So in 1543 , Nicholas Copernicus published &quot; The revolutions of Heavenly spheres , &quot; and by taking the Earth out of the center , and putting the sun in the center of the solar system , he opened our eyes to a much larger universe , of which we are just a small part .
They have to dig themselves out every day .
They cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs , some 8,000 miles from the drill site .
The 109th Air National Guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back to the coast of Antarctica , where it was boarded onto a freighter , shipped across the tropics to California , unloaded , put on a truck , driven across the desert to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver , Colorado , where , as we speak , scientists are now slicing this material up for samples , for analysis , to be distributed to the laboratories around the country and in Europe .
We ought to take them out back and shoot them , and put bounty hunters after them .
Just turn it over to the private sector , and we have an Internet .
And at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the United States , after two years , we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children , drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research , and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics , for designing computer-based products -- and , in fact , any kind of products -- for little girls , ages eight to 12 .
And sometimes I feel like I can &apos;t really enjoy myself unless it is like a vacation , like when I get Mondays and all those days off .
So they brought him in .
It is very straightforward -- you take a bunch of people , you split them in half , you treat one group one way , you treat the other group the other way , and a little while later , you follow them up and see what happened to each of them .
And their leaders , their leaders : before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country -- and you know the reason -- before they send them off , they go to a Christian church , and they pray to their Christian God , and they ask for protection and guidance from that god .
In low-fat butter , or actually in many low-fat products , when you take the fat out , you actually take the taste and the texture out .
so I called them up , and I asked , &quot; Can I borrow a heart valve from you ? &quot;
And you might remember the scene in which the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer , is asked to show his driver &apos;s license and holds his wallet out with a 50-dollar bill extending at a slight angle out of the wallet .
On the other hand , you want the damn guacamole . By expressing it as an if-then statement , you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around .
They paddle faster , and faster , and faster , until they are going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water , and they are standing upright , sort of paddling the top of the water .
Or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out into the natural world . We &apos;ll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world , who might inspire us .
And then the aperture closes , and we have to flush the pipes with toxins , or we have to dig them up .
And it is carving things down from the top , with 96 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product . You heat it up ; you beat it with high pressures ; you use chemicals . OK . Heat , beat and treat .
There are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device inside of purple bacterium , the people at ASU . Even more interesting , lately , in the last couple of weeks , people have seen that there is an enzyme called hydrogenase that is able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons , and is able to take hydrogen up -- basically what is happening in a fuel cell , in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell .
This is the simple design brief . I mean , it looks simple because the system , over 3.8 billion years , has worked this out .
I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of 30 for business school , a path I knew almost nothing about .
And so I have to figure this out for myself .
and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up .
and every time I use a paper towel , I am using this much virtual energy and water . Wipe it up , throw it away .
I wipe it up with a sponge , and I put it under the running water ,
and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water . Unless you are like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on ,
So now we add in the final construction energy , we add it all up , and we &apos;ve built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this .
Some students went out and netted some crows , brought them in , and were -- weighed them , and measured them and whatnot , and then let them back out again .
The problem now is collecting the bits , without getting run over .
Basically , what happens is that we put this out in a field , or someplace where there is lots of crows , and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine .
Now , like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing , this really pisses them off .
crows , on the other hand , show up , and they try and figure it out .
&quot; Hey , there is lots of coins lying around from the first stage , lying around on the ground , &quot; hops down , picks it up , drops it in the slot .
These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination .
Determination is , like , you are going to hang on that bull , even if you are riding upside down .
And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out .
And then they had to straighten out my nose , and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head , and everybody said that it should have killed me , but it didn &apos;t , because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain .
But the good thing was , once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose out , I could breathe , and I hadn &apos;t been able to breathe since I broke my nose in the high school rodeo .
they need to figure it out .
In the 1900s , early 1900s gynecologists , a lot of gynecologists believed that when a woman has an orgasm the contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix and sort of deliver it really quickly to the egg ,
The fall shattered his right arm , broke every rib that he had , punctured his lung , and he drifted in and out of consciousness as he drifted down the East River , under the Brooklyn Bridge and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry , where passengers on the ferry heard his cries of pain , contacted the boat &apos;s captain who contacted the Coast Guard who fished him out of the East River and took him to Bellevue Hospital .
We specked it out to actually be doable with a very , very low-cost bill of materials , so that it can become a childhood companion for kids .
I mean , when I asked them to summarize the 10 TEDTalks at the same time , some took the easy route out .
For example , for all the TEDTalks around food , someone summed this up into : &quot; Food shaping body , brains and environment , &quot; which I think is pretty good .
And so a year ago , I showed this off at a computer show called E3 .
His parents are too busy to listen to his problems , and that is when he starts almost conjuring you up .
So remember , this is the first time you &apos;ve met him , and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious .
We pick those words out .
PM : So , Milo is being called back in by his parents , giving us time to be alone and to help him out .
Now , to do that , we needed a set up , like a magician &apos;s trick .
So what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads , and you walk up to the one that can &apos;t speak very well , and you put the arrowheads down in front of him , hoping that he &apos;ll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows .
But he looks at the pile of arrowheads , thinks they are a gift , picks them up , smiles and walks off .
We turned the money over to that man there , the principal of the school .
Of course , most of China was flourishing at the time , but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of China .
He was kind of a gambler type -- and unemployable , therefore -- and took his frustrations out on her .
It is saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off , not that you &apos;d use it as a substitute for action .
And if you stick your tongue out at this baby , the baby will do the same .
They are not sitting in front of the mirror trying to figure themselves out , or thinking about themselves .
But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up .
Because , for example , the genes don &apos;t care whether we are happy , they care that we replicate , that we pass our genes on .
But with this small investment in a rat capacity , we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal -- two dollars per square meter , we do it at $ 1.18 , and we can still bring that price down .
She is just laid it down nice and tidy .
And what we found was this curious phenomena , that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum , making language as simple as possible , and then slowly ascend back up in complexity .
DR : She offers water , and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water .
And now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the context he saw it in ,
And I really want you to focus on something as I take you through .
You &apos;ll be able to figure that out .
But instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on .
Of course , first you have breakfast , and then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up , and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time .
So I had one of those , so I made some low-tech gadgetry , there , where you just stomp on the shoe last and then the door flies open , you throw your laundry down .
started with a rim there and then glued and nailed it up into a flat , corbelled it up and flipped it over , then did the two profiles on this side .
Let &apos;s take it out . Throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in .
If it doesn &apos;t work , take it down .
Fifteen percent suffer migraines that wipe them out for days on end .
But the system has moved me on because , as my family started to discover , there is no long-term concept in the health care system .
This thing blinks all the time ; I &apos;ll leave it out , so you might be able to see it .
And he was going to retire -- all the technology was going to be lost , because not a single medical manufacturer would take it on because it was a small issue .
Of course it is a logarithmic scale here , but our concept of economy is growth with percent . We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase . If I change this , and I take GDP per capita instead of family income , and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product , and I take the regions down here , the size of the bubble is still the population .
In spite of falling oil prices , he brought this country up here .
All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly-funded statistics . There are some web pages like this , you know , but they take some nourishment down from the databases , but people put prices on them , stupid passwords and boring statistics .
A search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world . And what do we hear when we go around ?
And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down .
And the reason for doing so , at the center of this photograph , is Linus Pauling . About six months before , he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins . And in doing so , he banished the man out on the right , Sir Lawrence Bragg , who was the Cavendish professor .
I just put them down like they were in the books .
and it is got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic .
We are not trying to get it down to just a few cases , because this disease is like a root fire ; it can explode again if you don &apos;t snuff it out completely .
One congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every 26 days -- in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs .
So you could get around the disease ; you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off .
And so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago , when people were saying , &quot; We should call it off , &quot; the Polio Partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions , new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again .
and every time we cut corners , more places get infected that shouldn &apos;t have , and it just slows us down .
BG : Well , hopefully we &apos;ll get the word out , and the governments will keep their generosity up .
But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality , that individual personality that these animals have .
And we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature and gang warfare .
It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety , protecting it from the hyena .
BJ : And then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000 .
You know , back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan : if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl , you could take her out on a chop suey date .
When medicine became somewhat scientific , in about 450 BC , with Hippocrates and those boys , they tried to look for herbs , plants that would literally shake the bad spirits out .
And the herbals , the botanical books of up to the late Middle ages , the Renaissance are filled with prescriptions for causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out .
So these three psychiatrists , after about two or three weeks of observation , laid him down on a table , connected his temples to a very small source of current .
So they decided -- I didn &apos;t know this , again , I found this out later -- that the only thing that could be done was for this 43-year-old man to have a pre-frontal lobotomy .
So we tried something out , and we wrote a message in a piece of silk , which is right here , and the message is over there .
And much like in the DVD , you can read it out optically .
Actually , as soon as someone turns it on , I go into the other room and read .
She explained that the father that she had had would tell them he &apos;d come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk .
Now I would do very small ones , which would be like -- but under the same light , and I would show them together , so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking .
They meet Neanderthals , mix with them , continue to spread over the world , and somewhere in Southeast Asia , they meet denisovans and mix with them and continue on out into the Pacific .
And I bring this up because it is important to locate this practice in history . To look at 1968 , in the incredible historic moment that it is , and think of the arc that has happened since then , to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this museum that came out of a moment of great protest and one that was so much about examining the history and the legacy of important African-American artists to the history of art in this country like Jacob Lawrence , Norman Lewis , Romare Bearden .
He checks you out , he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed , your shoulders are crushed down , and , of course , he is tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well .
And I realized that , if they came out of combat , it would be because we led them well .
They put a big screen up , and they take you through everything :
I walked out feeling as low And I saw my battalion commander , because I had let him down .
I connected high speed internet to it -- it is about three feet off the ground -- turned it on and left it there .
You know , stuff which I don &apos;t know anything about .
This sent shivers up my spine .
We used all of that , including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through .
Often , we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever .
It is amazing : just on the puny power of the sun -- by having a super lightweight plane , you are able to get it up there .
PM : If you can pass it down when you are done . Yeah , I think -- I lost a little orientation ; I looked up into this light . It hit the building . And the building was poorly placed , actually .
And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there , but you can fill in whatever you want . This is not a forecast .
We can probably get it down , but it is possible it is gone up to a greater destiny up there -- -- than it ever had . And I wanted to make -- just -- But I want to make just two points . One is , you think it is frivolous ; there is nothing to it . And yet if I had not been making ornithopters like that , a little bit cruder , in 1939 -- a long , long time ago -- there wouldn &apos;t have been a Gossamer Condor , there wouldn &apos;t have been an Albatross , a Solar Challenger , there wouldn &apos;t be an Impact car , there wouldn &apos;t be a mandate on zero-emission vehicles in California .
T : I don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
S : I don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
T : I don &apos;t ever want to let my country down .
S : I don &apos;t ever want to let my country down .
T : I don &apos;t want to let myself down .
S : I don &apos;t want to let myself down .
Now it is still in debt , but Chris has managed , through his own sacrifice , to get this film out .
And so this World Peace Game I &apos;d like to tell you about .
That is the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situations .
So I took one year off , and I went to this village science program .
Look at the pentagon , for instance , pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium .
In three minutes , you just fold this up .
teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years , they just muck up the definition and they spit it out .
And all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves . A huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down .
And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down .
So after a while , we could take that out , use it as a lightweight building block .
because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don &apos;t have diagnostic services , you end up creating a problem of drug resistance .
Build a team , open it up , offer prizes and so on .
You put them all together , you mix them up in a bouillabaisse , and you have consumer confidence that is basically a ticking time-bomb .
But if you stack it up , you just see this amazing , staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out .
But I read this fact the other day , that one trillion seconds equals 32 thousand years , so if you think about that , the context , the casualness with which we talk about trillion-dollar bailout here , and trillion there , we are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage .
We are working our way back up to that 10 percent .
But seriously , what we see happening , and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat , is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out .
We see that play itself out with empathy and respect .
I love this company . They &apos;ve created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households and create a consumer-based utility , where the electricity that they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace .
So the Apollo program paid for itself in inspiration , in engineering , achievement and , I think , in inspiring young scientists and engineers 14 times over .
What you are seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn &apos;t just glow like a white light , it just emits light at particular colors , a red one , a light blue one , some dark blue ones .
And so the fact that atoms , when you heat them up , only emit light at very specific colors , was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory , the theory of the structure of atoms .
You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory , get a telescope , swing it to the sky , and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun .
And if I blow it up there , you see it .
Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table , and I asked her , &quot; is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school ? &quot; And she , of course , naturally as a nine-year-old , looked at me and said quizzically , &quot; What is literacy ? &quot; So I sent her online , of course , to look it up .
I called my parents up .
I hunched my shoulder , I picked my backpack up again and I started walking .
I walked all the way up to Port Townsend , Washington , where I built a wooden boat , rode it across Puget Sound
So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we ’ ve shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
And once you have a very , very large budget , you actually look for expensive things to spend it on .
he just pulls them in , makes them look just like algae .
That is , we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone , but we need to scale these up , we need to build their capacity , so they are like the Southern Ocean , where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization .
So why don &apos;t I ask them what helped them succeed , and pass it on to kids ?
Here is what he wrote in starting that out . He said , Here it is . I am dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
We can surely sort this out .
So if our problem was to get the human economy down from 150 percent to 100 percent of the Earth &apos;s capacity , we could do that .
If we feel it now and think it through , we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself .
You scoop it up . You put it in cardboard boxes .
We are going to test them out . They &apos;ll probably all fail .
Then we &apos;ll test some other ideas out .
All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down .
You are killing people with your clinical trials . You need to shut it down now .
Shut it down at once . And there is this huge hubbub .
And I think this isn &apos;t 1,000 years out .
That is what we are moving into -- where it sort of knows these things down to that level .
this movement of the land that is a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it , and other parts are much more energetic and intense .
And of course , this is a photograph literally taken the night we were in hiding , as they divine their route to take us out of the mountains .
When a tree &apos;s done using its leaves -- its solar collectors , these amazing molecular photon capturing devices -- at the end of a season , it doesn &apos;t pack them up , take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves .
Well , except they &apos;ve been pre-warned now , and they &apos;ll know you are making it up .
That is my first love , and that is what I &apos;ll tell you a little bit about .
So if you want to put a million things down amongst eight million positions and you can have some of them overlapping , the clumps will be further apart .
If too much current is flowing , the intelligent receptacle turns itself off , and prevents another fire from starting .
they take your e-mail and every letter in your e-mail , they replace with 30-atom cluster -- one for each letter , A , T , C , and G in DNA . They string them up in the right sequence , and then they send them back to you via FedEx .
I mix them together , add a little bit of salt water , and then add this long strand I was telling you about , that I &apos;ve stolen from a virus . And then what happens is , you heat this whole thing up to about boiling . You cool it down to room temperature , and as you do , what happens is those short strands , they do the following thing : each one of them binds that long strand in one place , and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place , and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together .
They put their lives on the line , for us , for you , and we cannot let them down .
beginning guys , it is like , they thrash , they thrash , they get 15 feet up --
They put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell -- they tried this in rats -- it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion , and actually cures type 1 diabetes .
This is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle .
I am going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on .
So , WITNESS was started in &apos;92 and it is since given cameras out in over 60 countries .
And we &apos;ve also been trying to get computers out to the world , so that groups can communicate much more effectively , campaign much more effectively , but now we have the wonderful possibility , which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it , because that is cheap ; it is ubiquitous ; and it is moving fast all around the world -- and it is very exciting for us .
So I don &apos;t want somebody who is saying , &quot; Hey , I &apos;ve got a great idea in a business I know nothing about . I don &apos;t know who the players are . I don &apos;t know what the market is like . &quot;
I want you to say , or I want you to convey , that you are going to die if you have to , with your very last breath , with your fingernails scratching as they drag you out .
You stop , you &apos;ve got to figure it out .
On the other hand , there are a lot of things that drive me down , take the emotional level down , and you &apos;ve got to recover from those .
So , you &apos;ve got to take me through like a sixth grader -- dub , dub , dub , dub , dub -- but without patronizing me .
And now , you &apos;ve got to wrap it up and tie it up here .
After I brushed them off with a hand motion , they were very -- I finally was now accepted , and worked there for some six months .
This picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over .
AV : Well , I am glad Rufus is bringing this up , because you can notice where he dips in the first years where I think I was doing most of the work .
So the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty , but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences , that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit .
rates of depression carried on up , right across the Western world .
But interestingly too , it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism about how you embed the DNA of restless continual innovation into society , trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work .
So suddenly , I was interested in human-powered flight -- -- and did not -- the way I approached it , first , thinking about ways to make the planes , was just like they had been doing in England , and not succeeding , and I gave it up . I figured , nah , there isn &apos;t any simple , easy way . But then , got off on a vacation trip , and was studying bird flight , just for the fun of it , and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles , and measure the time , and estimate the bank angle , and immediately , figure out its speed , and the turning radius , and so on , which I could do in the car , as we are driving along on a vacation trip -- -- with my three sons , young sons , helping me , but ridiculing the whole thing very much .
But that began thinking about how birds went around , and then how airplanes would , how hang gliders would fly , and then other planes , and the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged , was so logical , one should have thought of it in the first place , but one didn &apos;t. And it was just , keep the weight down --
I thought back about if I was a space traveler , and came and visited Earth every 5,000 years . And for a few thousand visits , I would see the same thing every time , the little differences in the Earth .
Now , imagine building that up to a city , or to a society , and you &apos;ve got , obviously , an interesting problem .
If we can pull this off , if we can build more function , it will be stackable .
So he goes down , and he is sticking his tongue out like this .
Special people , special places , think up special ideas , then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers , who are passive .
Expand the pipeline down to the consumers .
special people , special places ; patent it , push it down the pipeline to largely waiting , passive consumers .
It is also going to now happen in virtual spaces , and we have to get better at figuring that out .
I &apos;ve been a little disingenuous , because I &apos;ve expanded it out in all its gory detail .
So the elements of life -- carbon , and oxygen and iron , all the elements that we need to make us up -- were cooked in those first generations of stars , which then ran out of fuel , exploded , threw those elements back into the universe .
So , I blew it up and ran into the living room , my finger where it shouldn &apos;t have been ,
The name was John James , and in those days , if a family member committed a crime , the military would hold you as ransom till your family turned themselves in .
And he would always laugh , and say , &quot; Come on , man , we &apos;ll make it out . &quot;
Every day , all of us here , we are building gods that have gone rampant , and it is time we started knocking them down and forgetting their names .
So one of the advantages of this design is , when you scale things down , the robot naturally becomes agile .
So on the left , you see Daniel throwing this robot up into the air .
One of the disadvantages of doing that is , as you scale things up -- so if you have lots of robots carrying the same thing , you are essentially effectively increasing the inertia , and therefore you pay a price ; they are not as agile .
Because that is the only way I am going to get my story across to you .
We are kind of like greedy kids , using it all up , aren &apos;t we ?
And now &amp;#91; these &amp;#93; new elements of human intolerance for river creatures like the gharial means that if they don &apos;t drown in the net , then they simply cut their beaks off .
But the problem is , you get hungry , so it ’ s hard to keep it off .
Dr . Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died , and we agreed that americans eat too many simple carbs , the &quot; bad carbs , &quot; and these are things like -- -- sugar , white flour , white rice , alcohol . And you get a double whammy : you get all these calories that don ’ t fill you up because you ’ ve removed the fiber , and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up .
And the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories , and it slows the absorption so you don ’ t get that rapid rise in blood sugar .
So we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to UCLA ; they added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture , and it inhibited the growth seven times more in the experimental group than in the control group -- 70 versus 9 percent .
And makeup is an additive process . You have to build the face up .
So , when you are faced with something like that , of course you &apos;ve got to break it down .
You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that .
But the reason I put this up here is because when I was in Africa last year , my wife and I were driving around , we had this wonderful guide , who showed us something that surprised both of us , and it was very revealing in terms of the fascination that comes with the design of animals .
They went down like elevators ; we got on them . They went back up , and the Bedouin -- each Bedouin , four of them -- got behind each of the camels with a little whip .
Pull its tail up ; take a look in there .
We had these big things that I weigh the bison on , for instance .
And I think you could boil this poem down to saying , &quot; Some days you eat the bear , other days the bear eats you . &quot; And it uses the imagery of dollhouse furniture .
But your face was absolutely straight when you twisted the lid down on the round tin where the matches , you said , are always stowed .
In Philippines in 2001 , President Estrada -- a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime , eventually brought it down and it was , of course , called the &quot; coup de text . &quot;
It walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can &apos;t be seen .
You can see it here well on this debris .
They are tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction to pull the leg out from debris , but they are stiff in the other direction so they capture disparities in the surface .
We can make spines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out .
Let &apos;s slow it down and you can see the spines in action .
It is extraordinary how fast it can do it -- but if you slow it down , you see something that is quite extraordinary .
If we slow it down , they attach their feet at eight milliseconds , and detach them in 16 milliseconds .
Can &apos;t you move them over to a place where there is less of a risk ?
We can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe , all the way back in time , almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself .
you can zoom in , you can pull back out . The whole resources are there available for you .
And so , what you &apos;ve seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here , and in the TED Lab , we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named Benjamin that will knock your socks off .
But what is even cooler is that if I have two fingers , I can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily .
If I grab the canvas , I can kind of do the same thing -- stretch it out .
I can do it simultaneously , where I am holding this down , and gripping on another one , stretching this out like this .
And I can bring that around , put that up there .
Well , I learnt a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time , but grew to know stuff about .
Shake your hands out .
You &apos;ve got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life . OK ?
because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on while I am keeping time with this .
This is the piece that I told you about .
The next piece that I am going to do -- which is the cylinders piece , if you want to get that up -- it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago , which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs . I love ceramics and all of that .
You pick them up , and once you see something that you are interested in , the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store .
We can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that , and get more information about the clothing that you are interested in as you are trying it on .
And so you can see that the goal is to bring some of the feedback that the people who had gone to the museum were giving , and get it up on the wall so everybody could see . Just for everybody to see .
Scott Adams ran into us and asked us if we wouldn &apos;t help to design the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert , which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn &apos;t pass it up .
You probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire , don &apos;t you , at the speed of light when you turn the light on . They don &apos;t.
Now of course , Google didn &apos;t pick this up at the time , so we reported this in the science article that we wrote .
If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes , you would literally cease to hear it .
Or just try this one on for size . Wow !
So I invite you to connect with me , connect with each other , take this mission out and let &apos;s get listening taught in schools , and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world -- a world of connection , a world of understanding and a world of peace .
And when you go home tonight , you are going to put your hand out there , and you are going to reach for the doorknob and you are going to notice it is in the wrong spot , and you &apos;ll go , whoa , something happened .
I can make it larger or smaller , I can change its brass to silver , I could make it a lever . I can change your door , put colors on ; I can put windows in . I can change a thousand things about your door , and in the two seconds you take to open your door , you are going to notice that something has changed .
And as you go up to the door , you know , let &apos;s check them off one at time .
If the wind blows them over , they are like beetles stuck there on the ground .
And the way you should do that is study the furniture , let it marinate in your mind , distract yourself , and then a few days later , go with your gut , because unconsciously you &apos;ve figured it out .
But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary , and keep the bad words out .
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up .
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the carriage , type his email or command and pull the paper out .
And if it is even more silent , they stretch their necks out .
But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of manages to pull itself up .
But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own .
When you add all these things up -- Saul Griffith did the numbers and figured out what would it take to get 13 clean terawatts of energy from wind , solar and biofuels , and that area would be roughly the size of the United States , an area he refers to as &quot; Renewistan . &quot;
A guy who is added it up all this very well is David Mackay , a physicist in England ,
And of course , with wind , you could put it all over the East Coast , offshore theoretically , or you can split it up .
So if we want to keep the lights on , we actually need a solution which is going to keep generating all of the time .
If we are going to keep the lights on , nuclear is that solution .
Now that is -- my take on that ... Just put up ... Hands up , people who changed their minds during the debate , who voted differently .
Those of you who changed your mind in favor of &quot; for &quot; put your hands up .
The ability for us to access these resources to gain planetary redundancy -- we can now gather all the information , the genetic codes , you know , everything stored on our databases , and back them up off the planet , in case there would be one of those disastrous situations .
If you calculate the amount of potential energy , mgh , to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles , and then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour --
remember , that one half MV squared -- and you figure it out . It is about 5.7 gigajoules of energy .
I have no question that the physics , the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner .
We offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship , carry three people up to 100 kilometers , come back down , and within two weeks , make the trip again .
There are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly , I think , to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight .
people think a zero gravity room , there is a switch on there that turns it off -- but it is actually parabolic flight of an airplane .
If we can get the audio up ?
Orteig didn &apos;t pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across -- tried to go across the Atlantic , and we didn &apos;t pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE .
You know , innovators , the entrepreneurs out there , you know that when you are going for a goal , the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself .
And then she said -- grabbed me like that , because my mother was quite big -- and she lifted me up and she says , &quot; How come you are not at school ? &quot;
So , to cut a long story short , I went home , went underneath the microscope , and I crushed up a piece of glass , crushed it up .
So I decided to slice these up with the tool that I make by -- I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade .
And then pushing the glass in with its own friction .
And I decided to build it up .
So I didn &apos;t think he was going to throw Bart off .
What I did , I plucked the tag out
Khaled : Why would I want to put it on ?
And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion -- in fact , the Koran says that &quot; God decreed upon himself compassion , &quot; or , &quot; reigned himself in by compassion &quot; --
All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way , get our egotism out of the way . I am sure , probably all of you here , or certainly the very vast majority of you , have had what you might call a spiritual experience , a moment in your lives when , for a few seconds , a minute perhaps , the boundaries of your ego dissolved .
And frankly , although I keep getting asked this , it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down under the circumstances .
And then I asked him a question , which I ended up asking to all the dads and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book .
And if you take this program out , and give it to your children , they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good , because they &apos;ve got parents like you .
And so what we do is , we start simple and we work our way up to living systems .
And I would use this study , a recent study by Philip Landrigan , to motivate a different view of health , where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan and the New York area and logged what they spent their patient hours on .
And what I want to show you is -- actually this is one of the components of it that we &apos;ve just recently been testing -- which is a solar chimney -- we have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment -- that passively draws air up .
Here &apos;s who put them up and who are avid pencil users .
Do you know what slows it down ?
But in that action , that interaction , by re-scripting that , by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate , that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent , which , like any chelating agent that we use medicinally , binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it is complexed by a reactive , effectively removing it from bioavailability .
Actually the theme of this conference , I think , has hit on really one of the major keys to pull that off --
And , you know , then you get all the way down to people who live in the Asia-Pacific region , or even more , Africa .
These are led lights that help the roughly billion people out there , for whom nightfall means darkness , to have a new means of operating .
If you are living in one of the places where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered , you can fling these seeds out into the field .
And this freaked the media businesses out -- it freaked them out every time .
You need to take them out of search engines , you need to take them out of online directories , you need to take them out of user lists .
She didn &apos;t speak to me for a very long time , because she thought I &apos;d let my family down .
Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life .
But these aren &apos;t the data . I made these up !
And then finally -- you know , the best of all possible worlds -- some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best , who was the original drummer for the beatles , until they , you know , sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour .
I called her up . &quot; Hello , how are you doing , baby ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; Well , you design a story when you make it up , it is entertainment when you tell it , and you are going to use a microphone . &quot;
I can &apos;t even make this part up because she is that tiny .
I am buckling in seatbelts from the front . I am yanking them in from the back . I am doing double knots .
And she is bringing me in with a slight salsa movement .
And I am really worried , because when people talk about cars -- which I know something about -- the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking , &quot; Let &apos;s use fuel-efficient cars . &quot;
These laptops , when a child opens them up , they communicate with every single child in the classroom , within that school , within that village .
We gave the office a few days off .
So we went back to the city and said we are not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform , but we &apos;ve spent some time down there .
We &apos;ve just rolled this out in the last couple months --
And instead of throwing it out , people would think that is a krump move , that is a krump move .
That is not a krump move . You are going to throw it out , you throw it out , and you hold it .
In response , three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the U.S. army many times over .
I &apos;ve put a bunch of examples up here .
I want you to do it fast , and say it out loud with me ,
Now the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud .
After a week , we took the stencils and the leaves off , shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot , so on day one the billboard said , &quot; Complaining is silly . Either act or forget . &quot;
If I want a spinning tail , let &apos;s grab a motor , put some play-dough on it , stick it on and we have spinning .
Hold the hand palm up . Do this , don &apos;t move the wrist .
Then you have to push it down again .
I didn &apos;t say , &quot; I am going to move my shoulder over , move my body . &quot;
You know , you &apos;ve come home from a long day , and you take a glass of wine , and you put your feet up .
It is the same with the Chopin . He is just about to reach the E , and he says , &quot; Oops , better go back up and do it again . &quot;
He goes back up to B. He gets very excited . Goes to F-sharp . Goes to E.
And I &apos;ve one last request before I play this piece all the way through . Would you think of somebody who you adore , who is no longer there ?
Now , we are all about to end this magical , on-the-mountain week , and we are going back into the world . And I say , it is appropriate for us to ask the question , who are we being as we go back out into the world ?
Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us .
But are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ?
We had stories like &quot; The Seven-League Boots &quot; : the giant who had these boots , where , once you put them on , with every stride you could cover seven leagues , or 21 miles , a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal .
They make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out .
We can get some things out on the Internet .
Clearly , I haven &apos;t gotten this message across .
A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down .
And you &apos;ll see in a second there , he comes back down to the floor .
And I like university professors , but you know , we shouldn &apos;t hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement .
And one more thing : No , don &apos;t F it up .
I mean like once I pick up one book I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book .
What we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi , at every degree of sweetness -- eight percent , 8.1 , 8.2 , 8.3 , all the way up to 12 -- and we try this out with thousands of people , and we plot the results on a curve , and we take the most popular concentration . Right ? Really simple .
And he would think it through and say , what was wrong ?
And he sat them down for two hours , and he gave them , over the course of that two hours , ten bowls .
When he and his sister Martha were just very little , their mom took them out to see a total eclipse -- or actually , a solar eclipse -- and not long after that , both of them started losing their eyesight .
Flight-or-fight releases adrenalin , which throws our walls up sky-high .
If you have a baby and you think that baby &apos;s gay , you should be allowed to put it up for adoption .
I even looked it up in the dictionary , to make sure that I actually do that , and the definition of play , number one , was engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor , and number two was gambling .
And I was up in my country house , and for some reason , I began painting these very big , very involved , laborious , complicated maps of the entire world , and listing every place on the planet , and putting them in , and misspelling them , and putting things in the wrong spot , and completely controlling the information , and going totally and completely nuts with it .
Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful , and you &apos;ll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday , but they sting like hell , and jellyfish sushi and sashimuses is just not going to fill you up .
And in the Mediterranean , in the swordfish net fisheries , they make up up to 90 percent .
And they &apos;ll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head , and the fish come up and they just clean , clean , clean -- because the molas , you know , there is just a smorgasbord of parasites .
And you are just wondering , oh , I hope the fish is safe , I hope , I hope it is going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording .
And it was discovered , and WHO endorses this , that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over , can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through .
which also goes back to Turing , who , before that , gave the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless , little , finite state machine , just reading a tape in and reading a tape out .
we saw it in starting these programs up . The instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail .
&quot; A short -- do not turn the machine on . &quot;
Please put your hands up .
put your hands up , aunties and uncles as well .
Can &apos;t even get them out the door -- and I am being serious --
I am not slacking them off .
I mean basically they &apos;ve weaned us on to these hits of sugar , salt and fat , and x , y , and z ,
For sure , pass it on as a philosophy .
And a month later , TED phoned me up and gave me this award .
It is axiomatic that they are dodgy , and they are going to want to try and rip you off .
And in the process , what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost , and have the infrastructure in place , instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges .
Suburban expansion to cheap land , for the last 50 years -- you know the cheap land out on the edge -- has helped generations of families enjoy the American dream .
It is keeping the lights on .
The night watchman had caught an employee who was stealing socks -- it was a hosiery mill , and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock and was shoveling in mountains of socks .
And I started this piece , particularly with stories and narratives , and I was talking to one woman and that led to another woman and that led to another woman , and then I wrote those stories down and I put them out in front of other people .
And I actually made up a little character whose name was Mr . Alligator , and I would call him up when things got really bad , and I would say it was time to come and pick me up .
Anyway , we arrived , and when we arrived , there were hundreds of girls dressed in red , homemade dresses -- which is the color of the Masai and the color of V-Day -- and they greeted us , and they had made up these songs that they were singing about the end of suffering , and the end of mutilation , and they walked us down the path .
So we went to the moon , played golf up there , before we went to the largest feature on our own planet .
I am going to talk about myself , which I rarely do , because I -- well for one thing , I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about .
I mean he had laid it all out .
I think this is what so , in fact , infuriated the scientists . But I like to cross boundaries . I like to , as I said , talk about things I know nothing about .
And I think it is good to talk about things I know nothing about because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it , you know ?
In a few years , NASA is going to launch four or five telescopes out to Jupiter , where there is less dust , and start looking for Earth-like planets , which we cannot see with present technology , nor detect .
If you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the Earth , it would be the thickness of two pence , at 14 pounds per square inch .
And you just , literally , have to send little nuclear factories up there that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of Mars and spit out the oxygen .
and they are going to hoot you off the stage .
And now , if you went into one of those conventions and you said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t think black holes are out there , &quot; they &apos;d hoot you off the stage .
Andrew , can you put that chart up ?
We sent a probe out to this asteroid belt , called NEAR , Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous .
Now , the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing is that you don &apos;t have anything to push against in space , because there is no air .
They will bring it and link it in .
In conjunction with our Canadian colleagues , we &apos;ve set this up .
We can think them out . We can create incredible things .
But I rather play something completely unheard of , and even with flaws , than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness .
Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
your guy will fry them up ?
My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on Inauguration Day , I was still changing it . Sure you were , because you &apos;ve prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you .
It didn &apos;t matter what she was crying about , she could get on my knee , she could snot my sleeve up , just cry , cry it out .
Hold your head up . Look at me .
And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box , I would find myself saying things like , Just go in your room . Just go on , go on in your room .
and at the same time , he was also giving me props , lifting me up , for not crying .
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good .
and I zip my pants up in front of them , and I head for the door .
But half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces , there would be no dial tone .
I am talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma .
So these proof of concept experiments led me to say &quot; I should found a company , and we should take this out to a wider playing field . &quot;
And this company , the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine , and the results are incredibly positive .
Now I ’ m not going to have time to spell it all out , but I ’ ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward .
And he would point this out as evidence that we fear the judgment of our peers , and that we ’ re embarrassed about showing our ideas to people we think of as our peers , to those around us . And this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our thinking .
It ’ s a toy ; it ’ s called a &quot; finger blaster . &quot; And I forgot to bring one up with me .
But before we start , I need just to put these on . Thank you . All right .
All right . I think I ’ m going to take these off now , because I can ’ t see a damn thing when I ’ ve -- all right , OK .
Keep your hands up if you did 10 .
It ’ s the plant from which you can create mescaline , one of the psychedelic drugs . For those of you around in the &apos;60s , you probably know it well .
When play is about building a tower out of blocks , the kid begins to learn a lot about towers .
And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again , learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play .
And I think the best way to achieve that , and get a feeling for any flaws in your design , is to act it out .
They dismiss an interesting interaction by saying , you know , &quot; That ’ s just happening because they ’ re acting it out . &quot;
So to sum it up , we need trust to play , and we need trust to be creative . So , there ’ s a connection .
And we were able to get some force measurements out .
I wanted you to notice that she actually turned to come back up .
And then I ’ d put my sunglasses on , the beard that would all sprout out , and I would say , &quot; I don ’ t need no stinking license . &quot;
So get your Tevas on .
not just the horses , but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk , that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died , and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street .
Because if we get it out of the streets , it &apos;ll smell much better , and -- oh right , we drink from the river .
I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple .
So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama , and I would hand them out .
And when I gave them to the people , they had either hold them to their heart , or they &apos;d hold them up to their head and just stay there .
Same thing : gave her a picture , she held it up to her forehead .
Eight years later , when they discovered there was a plot to kill him , they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback , and took the same trip that Tamdin did .
And this is -- I see this rolling out all over -- this is our site in Ollantaytambo , Peru , four years ago , where they first saw their first computers ; now they have computers in their classrooms .
And this is in Takaungu -- we &apos;ve got a generator and a digital projector , and we are projecting it up against a barn , and showing one of the movies that they made .
And so , I have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what I call the cosmic scene investigation , that is , looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning , and then following it up and trying to understand it .
We are going to try and follow it up .
We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study , and that is the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it is a time machine , in a certain sense .
So we have this picture , which is quite a spectacular picture , and I &apos;ll come back to the beginning , where we are going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning .
They go out and point a telescope at the sky , take a picture , identify what are stars and throw them away , look at the galaxies , estimate how far away they are , and plot them up . And just put radially they are going out that way .
How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that ?
It is not just throwing them out at random .
Now we are going to zoom back out , and you can see this structure that , when we get very far out , looks very regular , but it is made up of a lot of irregular variations .
So let &apos;s fly through it , and you can see how much harder it is when you are in the middle of something to figure this out .
We then place it in an oven-like device , and we are able to create that structure and bring it out .
The youngsters didn &apos;t have to feel that we were going to keep them over .
And I just wanted them to be able to hold their head up after a game .
To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here , his name is Julius .
&apos;In case you owe one month , the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out . He will confiscate your things , &apos;Armstrong said .
And every time , they sent scouts out there to make sure no one attacked them .
But these two people worked something out .
I am asking my friends from America to help with bringing nurses or doctors to help us out .
You should also keep your blood pressure down , because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer ’ s disease .
You try it out .
We set the place up , we opened up , we spent months and months renovating this place .
Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , necessarily , who don &apos;t have really active parents that are bringing them in , or aren &apos;t close enough ? &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1,400 people on our tutor roster .
We are working on our college essays . Send them in .
Isn &apos;t it ironic that christians who claim to believe in an infinite , unknowable being then tie God down in closed systems and rigid doctrines ?
when I went into space I carried a number of things up with me . I carried a poster
When you get older , and you are all freaked out , whatever , the mentors calm us down .
And so , to boil it all down , simplicity is about living life with more enjoyment and less pain .
It is all in the streams of information we consume daily , we just have to know how to pull it out .
We looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on .
We can push it up :
Or we push it down :
And depending on who you ask , the surge was supposed to push it up even further .
Another one gets really , really nervous if you get in to the room , and starts shaking , so you have to calm it down .
He rushes to the synagogue . &quot; I &apos;ll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it . &quot;
The lightest touch of her arm -- the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sleeve , of a garment , as she put it on -- caused excruciating , burning pain .
And when you turn the switch on , the light goes on .
And when you turn the switch off , the light goes off .
If you hit your thumb with a hammer , these wires in your arm -- that , of course , we call nerves -- transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires , new nerves , take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt .
It is almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch , the toilet flushed three doors down , or your dishwasher went on , or your computer monitor turned off .
If you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the Cold War , lumped them together and blew them up at the same time , that would be one one-millionth of the energy released at that moment .
Now , scoop up Long &apos;s Peak , and put it out in space .
In fact , Apophis is a blessing in disguise , because it woke us up to the dangers of these things .
The purpose wasn &apos;t to push it out of the way .
The purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet , which we learnt quite a bit about .
You shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing , you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you &apos;ll just miss it .
The government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in Bratislava .
Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf , does not hear , and switch the lights off .
So he put the pen down .
But instead , surprisingly , he said , &quot; Oh , bring her down here for a year , and if I can &apos;t win her over , no one can . &quot;
I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church , wishing harm to others , being mean to my sisters .
What happens to matter if you chop it up very fine ?
I &apos;ll let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer ,
Then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set down here , showing that symmetry exhibits better and better .
And he realized suddenly that the force that drew the apple down to the earth could be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon .
You very quickly work out what is it that you &apos;ve got to do to fathom that out . How do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day , the 21st of September ?
Because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there &apos;d be more -- when we got into certain areas , maybe there would be more people interested .
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back .
For example , when I walked up here and I took the microphone from the stand and switched it on , you assumed this was a microphone , which it is not .
diluting it down to the point where there is none of it left .
It is exactly equivalent to taking one 325 milligram aspirin tablet , throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe , and then stirring it up , obviously with a very big stick , and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous .
Now , let me tell you , The James Randi Educational Foundation is waving this very big carrot , but I must say , the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer doesn &apos;t mean that the powers don &apos;t exist .
So when this machine breaks , the machines they have to work with break , they &apos;ve got to try and figure it out , but most of the time , that is the end of the road .
But there is no way to treat animals well , when you are killing 10 billion of them a year .
I want to talk today about -- I &apos;ve been asked to take the long view , and I am going to tell you what I think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view .
If we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up , then the figure becomes astronomical .
So I got it down to just one tether to be able to support that .
But with the pendulum , it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets up .
I try to refine them down to very simple forms .
And here is where the dead people start to help us out ,
Whether you look up or look down , how do you get it up in space ? You &apos;ve got to get it up there in a rocket .
Well , about the only way is to fold it up somehow .
Folded lens , you divide up the panels , you add flexures . But this pattern is not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters .
And in a moment , I am going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;ll see on this graph -- it begins in 1973 , just before women start flooding the workforce , and it brings us up to our current day .
And if , but only if , we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change , and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here .
At the time of injury or disease , the body &apos;s first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body .
It basically wants to fight off infection , and seal itself , whether it is organs inside your body , or your skin , the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in , to seal itself off from the outside .
The strategy here , is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ , you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ , less than half the size of a postage stamp , you can then tease that tissue apart , and look at its basic components , the patient &apos;s own cells , you take those cells out , grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities , and then we then use scaffold materials .
And as a young kid , nobody can say it can &apos;t happen because you are too dumb to realize that you couldn &apos;t figure it out .
So this thing right here is freaking me out .
This one person offered me three cents and I got him up to three and a half .
At seven years old I figured it out . I got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers .
I asked him what he did with it , and he said he just throws it out .
and making money off that too .
So I would go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes .
You just pick them up with both feet .
Yeah , but you know what ? You stuff that down your shorts , when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free , everybody bought them .
I remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in Banff , Alberta because I had thrown a penny out in the street , and my dad said , &quot; Go pick it up . &quot;
When you see grumpy customer service , point that out to them .
You are not the first to try to figure this out , just as you are unlikely to be the last .
Now , when we tried to challenge this , going to the Supreme Court , getting the Supreme Court , the bunch of conservatives there -- if we could get them to wake up to this -- to strike it down ,
The president , who has supported a process that secretly negotiates agreements , which effectively lock us into the insane system of DMCA that we have adopted and likely lock us down a path of three strikes , you are out that , of course , the rest of the world are increasingly adopting .
started a website back in 2005 , with a few friends of mine , called Reddit.com. That is what you &apos;d call a social news website . Basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web . You find some interesting content , say a TEDTalk , submit it to Reddit , and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it , vote it down if they don &apos;t.
In fact , someone on Reddit thought , &quot; Oh , what a great thing , we should all vote this up . &quot;
And he had a platform where you linked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
He had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board .
While he still held that worldview , I was 16 , I got the best lawyer in town , my older brother Karthik , and I sat him down , and I said , &quot; Pa , from today onwards I &apos;ve decided I am going to be disciplined , I am going to be curious , I am going to learn something new every day , I am going to be very hard working , and I am not going to depend on you emotionally or financially . &quot;
Anyway , the next slide I am about to show you -- Should I just turn that off ?
I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl -- that is me there -- because she wanted a girl , and she has only boys .
And I drew it out for her .
When you pick your aunt up at the airport , you get a sedan .
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
But yesterday the city called them and said , &quot; Look , we are going to have to tear it down . Because this can be taken for advertising , and because of the law , it has to be taken down . &quot;
So now my wish is : I wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project , and together we &apos;ll turn the world inside out .
Well , before we wrap it up , she would like to give a shout out to all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo .
I would run into the living room , jump up on the couch , rip the cushions off , throw them on the floor , scream at the top of my lungs and run out
My first evening , before my first day of school , I said to my mother , very politely , &quot; Please wake me up at eight a.m. &quot; So ,
So then we broke it down .
So when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me , you think , oh , this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish . But when we &apos;ve seen quality tests -- and there haven &apos;t been enough of these yet and I am really encouraging people to do more , comparing Wikipedia to traditional things -- we win hands down .
The reporters called me up and they -- I mean , I have to say they spelled my name right , but they really wanted to say , the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious , it is tearing apart the Wikipedia community . And so they quote me as saying , &quot; They are the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia . &quot;
Nobody else saw this but I found it in a book , and I found a link to a page that describes it , and I am going to clean it up tomorrow , so please don &apos;t delete it , then it would survive .
And for a lot of people in the world , if I give you an encyclopedia that is written at a university level , it doesn &apos;t do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point where you can actually use it .
Now you can just go on Google . Just look it up .
Commentator : There is that 90 degree turn you are talking about , taking him out .
Commentator Two : And what he is going to do as he approaches the ground is pull down on those toggles to flare , slow himself down just a little bit , and then come in for a nice landing .
Better put that up .
Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses , or you &apos;ve had laser refractive surgery ?
And there is no better , sexier , more beautiful , charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on .
I put my flippers on . I could barely part my lips .
And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me .
We &apos;ve got to get the story out now . Thank you very much .
And if you do that , that is the essential move to cultivate moral humility , to get yourself out of this self-righteousness , which is the normal human condition .
And so the suggestion is , well hey , if we are going to send robots out and allow them to do this , maybe it would be a good idea , again , with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person , again , they haven &apos;t actually killed them .
That &apos;ll speed them up . Everything will work out better that way .
Now they don &apos;t know what they want to do with it , but they are going to figure it out .
They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it .
But it is important to understand that a lot of the origins of our industries -- even like Henry Ford -- come from this idea of playing and figuring things out in groups .
In order to pull glamour off , you need this Renaissance quality of sprezzatura , which is a term coined by Castiglione in his book , &quot; The Book Of The Courtier . &quot;
And while Ivan is away the wind comes , and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass . And now , here comes the other pirate .
When you hear clicks , we are turning the machine on .
No , we speed them up , don &apos;t we ? So we used to dial ; now we speed dial .
And even things that are by their very nature slow -- we try and speed them up too . So I was in New York recently , and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course , a new evening course .
It is all that adrenaline rush . It is hard to give it up .
I think there is a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger , deeper questions .
I play squash and ice hockey , two very fast sports , and I wouldn &apos;t give them up for the world .
And I got to work and they took me somewhere down there , nine kilometers away from the town and the temple , and said , &quot; That is where we have chosen the location . &quot;
Maybe pulling bits off ? I am not asking about that .
So , I &apos;ve been writing it down for 15 years now .
They are making it all the way across to East Africa .
The wind will swoosh them out across here .
I thought I &apos;d talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this , and then get John back out here so we can talk interactively a little bit more and think and ask questions .
I built -- I put a garage-door opener up in the attic that would pull this door up .
I thought it was such a good idea from my perspective , and it was just absolutely never used , and we ultimately -- I think we &apos;ve now turned it off , if I remember .
A point beyond which you don &apos;t know anything else about your ancestors , and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance .
If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body , and stretch it end to end , it is around two meters long .
And so when you are copying this DNA molecule to pass it on , it is a pretty tough job .
Keep your hands up if you have sufficient life insurance .
Get out of it , get it out .
That is where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality , come in , release her spirit .
It is this well-organized absence of information that draws us in .
We can &apos;t stop ourselves from wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in .
And when an artist does that to another artist , it is like you are compelled to pass it on .
We can get productivity up .
We can get efficiency up .
But we &apos;ve also got to get consumption down .
We lined them up side-by-side , and we put the names of the companies that work on each of those .
And when we first met , one of the things that I remember is that he took me out on a date .
I am not making this up .
I mean , in America , people buy cars , and they put very little money down .
So , actually , at home , whenever we break a wineglass , I save the bottom , take it over to the machine shop .
We shave it off , and I have a little gravitational lens , OK .
Now , move the base off to the side , and the ring will split up into arcs , OK .
Now it turns out , in the mathematics , you can put it in as a term that is an energy ,
So it is really unexplained as to why we need to put it in .
And what was so sad about this particular story was that once their parents had found out -- and don &apos;t forget , their parents took them to the doctor -- the parents threw them out on the street .
And then they repackage them and sell them out on markets for literally more money than a sterile syringe in the first place , which is quite bizarre .
And they are collected en mass -- you can see the scale of it here -- and sorted out , by hand , back into the right sizes , and then put back out on the street .
You load it up in the normal way . This is made on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license .
You give the injection and then put it down .
And most people knock them down when they are small .
And like , knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up .
They actually export water molecules through .
They export water molecules through , and leave solutes on the other side .
It is capillary action and transpiration pulls water up , a drop at a time , pulling it , releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots .
Let &apos;s lock her up .
Let me wrap it up .
And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
It didn &apos;t leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide ; the people did .
Which was -- back then it was sort of , you know , well , you know -- if you made this thing -- he made this little device , like kind of like a bicycle pump in reverse that could suck all the air out of -- you know what a bell jar is ? One of these things , you pick it up , put it down , and it is got a seal , and you can see inside of it , so you can see what is going on inside this thing .
And people in the 17th century , they didn &apos;t really understand the same way we do about you know , this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules , and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that .
One thing , he put a bird in there , and he pumped all the air out , and the bird died . So he said , hmm ...
It was 300,000 , probably , years ago that most of us , the ancestors of most of us in this room came up out of Africa and turned to the left .
They send it out for amateur rocketeers , and it said in there do not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar .
And she was usually just sort of keeping an eye on , and if there was any puffs of smoke out there , she &apos;d lean out and admonish us all not to blow our eyes out . That was her -- You know , that was kind of the worst thing that could happen to us .
But I -- it took me about -- it took me about , I &apos;d say , six months to finally figure out all the little things .
At any rate , I bring it up because it is a good story , and he said , tell personal things , you know , and that is a personal -- I was going to tell you about the first night that I met my wife , but that would be too personal , wouldn &apos;t it .
They made bigger guns to shoot them down with .
And they weren &apos;t the curious little boys that liked to put frogs up in the air .
So the planet is a pretty amazing thing , you know , it is big and horrible -- and big and wonderful , and it does all kinds of things we don &apos;t know anything about .
And if you just listen to the guys who are hyping those issues , and making a lot of money out of it , you &apos;ll be misinformed , and you &apos;ll be worrying about the wrong things .
And when I was done , he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet and kindly walked me out .
They took the basic ingredients , put them in a single jar and ignited them and put a lot of voltage through .
We want to put it out in the environment , and we want it to be powered by the Sun .
It is fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together .
And the way to do that , that is to get child mortality down , get access to family planning and behind that drive female education .
One day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of a convex lens .
With the industrial economy , it is about controlling costs -- getting the costs down as low as possible so we can offer them to the masses .
So , I made this device , linked it up , and the wishbone walks . And because the wishbone is bone -- it is animal -- it is sort of a point where I think we can enter into it .
I just like , throw it in .
Because we kept on seeing this over and over and over again in different parts of the body .
And I am more of the , &quot; life &apos;s messy , clean it up , organize it and put it into a bento box . &quot;
And I am like , knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A &apos;s.
I want to hack into these things I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see .
And so I pulled back out of the research and thought , I need to figure out what this is .
As you know , it is not going to turn out well .
It was funny , I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says , How would you define vulnerability ?
I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor .
So , the patients print it out , because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network .
Lithium , that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder , that a group in Italy found slowed ALS down in 16 patients , and published it .
And then we say , &quot; Well how do we line them all up ? &quot;
So , we line them all up so they go together around the meaningful points , integrated across everything we know about the patient .
So , we couldn &apos;t run a clinical trial , we couldn &apos;t figure it out .
We hired them , set them up , assisting at lab .
And when it is in this form , if I combine it with a polymer and affix it to your window when it is in its colored state , it will reflect away all heat and light , and when it is in its bleached state it will let all the light and heat through and any combination in between .
And then I am going to turn the lights out .
EBox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside , hold it until you need it , and then be able to release it and pass it off .
And if I don &apos;t need it , I can convert it back up on the window to energy , light , and beam it , line of site , to your place .
... heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet , for which I have yet to be thanked , I was trying as hard as I could -- she didn &apos;t even see it coming -- I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior .
Because maybe we can glean information -- not just how to move people up to the average , but how we can move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide .
Another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys .
I want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody .
But less directly , the lack of male presence in the culture -- you &apos;ve got a teachers &apos;lounge , and they are having a conversation about Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground .
You &apos;d buy that thing , you &apos;d bring it home , you &apos;d plug it in , and it would do absolutely nothing at all .
it was almost a block in the economy in New England , because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors .
We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet , but in order to get true temes and true teme machines , you need to get the variation , the selection and the copying , all done outside of humans .
Now , what about what else is going on out there in the universe ?
Now , it could have killed us off . It could have killed us off ,
Could it be that this experiment in imitation , this experiment in a second replicator , is dangerous enough to kill people off ?
And the fellow in the vest there , Craig Toten , he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this .
Now , you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point , and you must have wondered what is the right approach .
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity -- or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly -- you take a long time , but each second is not as painful -- which one of those is the right approach ?
And you weigh these options out -- you do the simple cost-benefit analysis , and you decide whether it is worthwhile to commit the crime or not .
I &apos;ll quickly play a short part of the air , and then I am going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you are not warmed up , so , if I mess it up , pretend you like it
until they were finished , so of course , what we would do is we &apos;d get on the piano and you wouldn &apos;t even get off to eat , because you wouldn &apos;t want to give it up to your brother or sister , and they &apos;d wait and you &apos;d be still sitting there on the piano , but it was their way to get us to practice .
And sorry about that , but this is what turns me on .
It is boosted to near-space atop a Minotaur IV rocket . Now the Minotaur IV has too much impulse , so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an 89 degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory .
So we were looking at how we could make a power station , that , instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside , could be a place that pulls you in .
And if a cloud goes past , you can see a cloud on the tips where it is letting the light through .
Well , this is what happens when you pair people up at random .
Someone asked me whether I stuck it in in order to deflect ire from discussions of gender and Nazism and race and so on . I won &apos;t comment on that .
Lamb goes on the post , she opens it up .
Melanie picks up the lamb , puts it on the post , opens it up .
Just bite &apos;em off .
The guy &apos;s worth -- he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down , outside of Vegas .
Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens , it cannot be the right strategy , either pragmatically , or spiritually , or morally , to say after the war , &quot; Well , let &apos;s let it all run itself out , and play out however it wants to play out , because we opposed the war in the first place . &quot;
And collectively , we really didn &apos;t know if we could pull this off .
He is got headphones on , reading the newspaper , got a hat on , glasses , got a bag .
You can &apos;t open yourself to new experiences , new people , new ways of doing things -- they might take you off course .
And so you spend your days fighting things off , defending your territory and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking .
But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up . So I actually went to school in Belfast , which was where all the action happened .
And I am going to show you up to maybe 2007 .
so here we have this triangle , and if we surround that C square with three more triangles and we copy that , notice that we can move those triangles down like this . And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ... and bingo . That is all you have to do .
Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious , which I thought for a long time , until she explained to me was to slow them down so they &apos;ll think .
So they are cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up .
But the whole point of this thing is for them to look at this chart and fill it out .
And then the teacher , Gillian Ishijima , had the kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor ,
If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again , I just drag these guys out and set them going .
And so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up .
and if I stack these guys up , then we see the differences ; the increase in the speed is constant .
That means that we , once again , have a thing where we can put technology out , but the mentoring that is required to go from a simple new iChat instant messaging system to something with depth is missing .
There is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well .
He said , &quot; I can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life . &quot;
And that will happen , paradoxically -- everything you hear about global warming -- when we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million , we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis , and there go animals .
He couldn &apos;t match it up to any bones on the planet , and he said , Aha ! It is extinct .
And I throw this slide in -- this is me , actually , two months ago -- and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal , chambered nautilus .
We pulled it up ; up it comes . So , it is out there with me at night .
So , he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours , sometimes six hours , and these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here .
You want to see the classic sweatshop , meet me at Madison Square Garden , I &apos;ll take you down the street , and I &apos;ll show you a Chinese sweatshop .
But we break it down to some basic realities .
&quot; And , baby , &quot; I &apos;ll tell her , don &apos;t keep your nose up in the air like that . I know that trick ; I &apos;ve done it a million times .
It can crumble so easily , but don &apos;t be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it .
So I write poems to figure things out .
She was maybe eight feet tall and looked like she could beat me up with one hand , but instead she just nodded at me and said , &quot; Hey , I really felt that . Thanks . &quot;
And fourth , someone has something you thought you knew everything about , but they are introducing a new angle of looking at it .
And I wondered whether I &apos;d get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out , or not .
And yet , for someone who is apparently done this already , I still haven &apos;t figured anything out yet .
Someone saw me on television ; they called me up ; and they asked me if I &apos;d like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were travelling in a bus ride from San Francisco to England . And I said , yes , I would do that , so I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called &quot; Medicine Ball Caravan . &quot;
I &apos;ve always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off , who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic -- people like Martin Luther King , Jr . ,
Radio : ... just fuckin &apos;, once you get on &apos;em just open &apos;em up .
but we are presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
And we got a report -- a sort of engineering analysis into what happened -- saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
So under that basis , we put it out and said , Look , we are skeptical about this thing .
And we wanted to figure this out , because if we could figure that out , then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening .
So that peak expiratory flow rate , I &apos;ve entered it up into the interactive software model .
They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment , yet their courage and talent brought them through .
So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids , saying , &quot; Now , whatever you do , don &apos;t stare at her legs . &quot; But , of course , that is the point .
So at the time , it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs .
As Lord Blackstone described it , land is protected by trespass law , for most of the history of trespass law , by presuming it protects the land all the way down below and to an indefinite extent upward .
You can break this out by states .
And you can break it out by counties , because it is specific counties .
The next day , Tom opens his lunchbox , there is rice , so he throws himself off and kills himself , and Tom , Dick and Harry follow .
Shut him up .
We parse it out on an as-needed basis , sometimes for very good reasons , other times just because we don &apos;t understand the gaps in our lives .
Diane Downs : At night when I close my eyes , I can see Christie reaching her hand out to me while I am driving , and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth .
And it got me through some -- I didn &apos;t make any royalties on this , but it got me through .
And every now and then , we do something like a , you know , an automated hair wrap machine , you know , that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out , and -- and we &apos;d make some money on that , you know . And we &apos;d give it out .
And I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol that means something , to me anyway .
But they have a closed system , so you couldn &apos;t print the things out on the machine .
So we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors .
And we are going to try to really pull this off , intentfully try to make something that seems like it is alive .
John , do you want to bring him up ?
And we think we can help that out by having little creatures that you can love .
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers ,
Now , that played itself out in the World Cup campaign .
And it is got these jet thrusters up in front that it &apos;ll use in a moment , and a little light .
If you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that , put them on one side of the scale , put all the jelly-type of animals on the other side , those guys win hands down .
Here is a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm , waiting for that worm to stick his head out .
And then there is earthquakes , and then volcanic eruptions , on the order of one every five years , that completely wipes the area out .
To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories .
And ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you didn &apos;t have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out , or you didn &apos;t have sufficient information and had to go find some .
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we are looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that is it .
How long will it take it to fill it up ?
And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
Everyone is filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , &quot; How long will it take ? &quot;
At night they get covered in pollen , which showers down over them , and then the bristles that we saw above , they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out , covered in pollen --
And they get inside , and they get it all on .
You see San Francisco and Los Angeles start to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left-hand corner .
So zooming back out real quick , we see , again , the U.S. -- you get Florida down in the right-hand corner .
The lyrics to the leading track are &quot; Ain &apos;t no grave can hold my body down . &quot; So we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash .
for the countless , countless hours I had lost in negative thought -- all the time I had spent beating myself up for losing my marriage and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid and career moves and this and this and this .
It is not going to feel this good all the way across .
They drag him out on the boat , and he is -- evidently , I didn &apos;t see any of this -- but lying on the boat and giving himself epinephrine shots and crying out .
And they got me out and they started again with the epinephrine and the prednisone and with the oxygen and with everything they had on board .
The devastation of those stings had taken the respiratory system down so that I couldn &apos;t make the progress I wanted .
So you can take it off the wall .
And then you can just walk behind them and try them on .
So artist books , you take them off the wall .
You know you have 46 chromosomes . If you are lucky , you &apos;ve got 23 from each parent . Sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out , but -- so you can skip the grandparent and great-grandparent stage and go right to the great-great-grandparent . And you have 46 people and you give them a scanner , or whatever you need , and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best , or she -- no reason to have just two sexes any more , even . So each child has 46 parents , and I suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children . Wouldn &apos;t that be enough ? And then the children would get plenty of support , and nurturing , and mentoring , and the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy .
And you let a few million of them out at a time .
So I think the future , main problem of psychology is to classify types of predicaments , types of situations , types of obstacles and also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up .
Saying , not what are the situations , but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies , how do you learn them , how do you connect them up , how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth .
You can put it on for two weeks and send it in the mail .
And this article from The Economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world :
The wireless institute , the West Wireless Health Institute , is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening : Gary and Mary West . And I &apos;d like to give it up for them for getting behind this .
You don &apos;t have to heat them up as hot as you would something you do pressure canning because bacterial spores can &apos;t grow in the acid .
As it comes out of the grinder , you just have a little tray , and you just take it off in little passes , build it up , slice it vertically .
The other amazing thing is , when this ballistics gelatin comes down , it falls back down as a nice block .
Transplantation : you could take an organ out of one person , you could put it in another person , and it would work .
With all its bells and whistles , one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon .
So something like a prostatectomy -- the prostate is small , and it is in one spot , and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot . And so it is perfect for something like that .
And you need to re-set it up .
We can inject these dyes into the bloodstream , so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart , we can see if we actually made the connection , before we close that patient back up again --
Kevin Bales : Okay , you figured it out . That is a spoof .
and they &apos;ve been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction , which I think is kind of fun .
you crumple them up , and then when you are done with them you just throw them away .
And in a way , without us even noticing , has ended up standing on the precipice of its own extinction , waiting for us to give it a big boot and knock it over . And get rid of it .
And that means , when you multiply it up , the estimated cost of not just freedom but sustainable freedom for the entire 27 million people on the planet in slavery is something like 10.8 billion dollars -- what americans spend on potato chips and pretzels , what Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system : usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans , or in the last holiday period when we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people , we spent 10.8 billion dollars .
They take their kids out of the workplace , they build a school , they say , &quot; We are going to have stuff we &apos;ve never had before like three squares , medicine when we are sick , clothing when we are cold . &quot;
Four million people were lifted up out of slavery and then dumped . Dumped without political participation , decent education , any kind of real opportunity in terms of economic lives , and then sentenced to generations of violence and prejudice and discrimination .
They were always trying things out .
And Charles just checking it out there .
You try things out .
And you try something out .
but I found a retired geology professor to take me down ,
TT : Yeah , I did plug it in .
You don &apos;t even know if it is safe to go back down to the water , to catch a boat to the hospital .
&amp;#91; Unclear &amp;#93; They called me out here .
They said , &quot; The blogsters let us down . &quot;
A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed , which is unfortunately more in the news these days .
It also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on , so the more they put themselves under load , the more it attaches .
And if you turn the lights on , you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by , because those are the denizens of the deep , the things that live in the deep ocean .
The census actually tried to look back in time , using every source of information they could get their hands on .
So , Steven Spielberg , eat your heart out .
And when I did , I thought , well , I had better look this word up in the dictionary .
If you have appendicitis , they take your appendix out , and you are cured .
What about the problem of picking up a chess piece , dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board ?
You send a command down , it causes muscles to contract .
And I &apos;ve put the formula up there .
So you send a command out , you get sensory feedback back , and that transformation is governed by the physics of your body and your sensory apparatus .
So as you send a movement command down , you tap a copy of that off and run it into your neural simulator to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions .
And based on this illustration , we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain is making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations .
They predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off .
And that player has been told , remember the experience of that force and use your other finger to apply the same force down to the other subject &apos;s finger through a force transfuser -- and they do that .
And player two has been told , remember the experience of that force . Use your other hand to apply the force back down .
My daughter -- the day we got it , I was tucking her in -- and I said , Honey , you are my treasure . And she said , No , the Lego is the treasure . And then she said , Dad , we are Lego rich . I was like , Yeah .
A parachute opens up to slow it down .
And we see a blip up in the truckers &apos;purchases of fuel , and we know that a recession is about to end .
He was in Lebanon . Amazingly , he was in Lebanon -- the U.N. base was used -- Palestinians staged attacks out from behind the U.N. base .
And we can see brain volumes up to 40 percent less in these children .
Well I find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count .
When disaster strikes -- the economy gets blown , people lose a job , floods , war , conflict , bad governance , all of those things -- there is nothing to fall back on .
And we said , listen , during the lean season , take the food out .
We &apos;ll pick it up . We &apos;ll make sure it is stored properly . -- their yields have gone up two- , three- , fourfold and they figure it out , because it is the first guaranteed opportunity they &apos;ve had in their life .
This is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if I leave it on .
Put them on and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be .
And here we are coiling them up .
So , let &apos;s switch it on . But to do it , what you have to do is you have to make this come alive .
We can load up all the neurons , each one on to its processor , and fire it up , and see what happens .
So all my life I have wanted to find this stuff out , and spent the last four years tracking these old guys down .
Jeff Bezos kindly , yesterday , said he &apos;ll put this video up on the Amazon site -- some little clip of it .
So I can put some lines on ; it doesn &apos;t help .
I can cover the rest of the cube up . And if I cover the rest of the cube you can see that they are identical .
And I called them up . And they went to check what was going on .
But now if you have an option that nobody wants , you can take it off . Right ?
You all know remote controls have an infrared led -- basically you switch on the led , and if it is off , you switch it off .
Well , now you ramp that up to four , and you have a lot of complexity , a lot of ways to describe mechanisms .
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out .
You can do a very simple test : scrape your cheek ; send it off .
Now , you have the genome and you say to yourself , So , if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in -- does it just boot up and live ?
We can start to figure that out .
Nature has put a set of rules out there .
You see someone in the park -- and I &apos;ll cover my mic when I say this , because I don &apos;t want to wake you up -- and there is the owner in the park , and their dog is over here , and they say , Rover , come here .
If that had been a dog , I would have laid him out .
If he had kicked a dog , I would have punched him out .
The moment the cores get to mid level , we finish the art museum ; we put all the mechanical equipment in it ; and then we jack it up into the air .
CA : And what did you make the windmill out of ?
You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research .
and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
You render it down . You make a candle , etc. etc. How long is it going to take you ? Quite a long time .
What happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
And as you get all the way up close , you realize that it is actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups .
And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels that are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide .
So , I made this image out of Barbie dolls , and so , as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern , and as you get all the way back , you see 32,000 Barbie dolls , which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the U.S. each month .
Now , I want to emphasize that these are just examples . I am not holding these out as being the biggest issues . They are just examples .
I took a bunch of these small picornaviruses , like the common cold , like polio and so on , and I just broke them down into small segments . And so took this first example , which is called coxsackievirus , and just break it into small windows .
We took our chip over to Hewlett-Packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots , and this is what you see : you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here .
That is the idea , and we are setting this up in the Bay Area .
Here , I &apos;ll give it one eye in the middle , maybe scale it up a bit . Point it down .
So this is the planet that we &apos;ve been playing on up to this point in the game .
but then over time -- I can speed it up just a little bit -- we &apos;ll actually see the heat impact of that as well .
Because it is so hard for people to think 50 or 100 years out , but when you can give them a toy , and they can experience these long-term dynamics in just a few minutes , I think it is an entirely different kind of point of view , where we are actually mapping , using the game to re-map our intuition .
Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds , and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant , crawl into its brain , and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle .
We are a free society , so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off .
But so , curious , I run up to the child -- of course scaring the living bejesus out of him -- grab him by the collar , turn it over , and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater .
And at the same time , what keeps me up at night is a fear that we &apos;ll look at the victories of the G8 -- 50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa , 40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory , as more than chapter one , as our moral absolution .
But previously it is only been created for large-scale farms , so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre .
And if I can broaden this out for a second , I am willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room would be happy to speak with acuity , with total confidence , about movies , probably about literature .
Well what I learnt is whenever tempers rise in those communities , someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush , and then everyone sits around in a circle like this , and they sit , and they talk , and they talk .
So we have to try these devices out because the FDA won &apos;t just let us use them on people unless we try it out first , and the best model for this happens to be pigs .
It &apos;ll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because , if you don &apos;t , you are in deep doo-doo .
I took it out for the first time to come here .
In fact , so many different points of resonance that it is going to be difficult to bring them all up , but I &apos;ll try to do my best .
Remember we took the book , tore the pages out ?
I didn &apos;t quit the Media Lab ; I stepped down as chairman -- which was a kind of ridiculous title , but someone else has taken it on , and one of the things you can do as a professor , is you stay on as a professor .
It is because you can go to a manufacturer -- and I will leave the name out -- but we wanted a small display , doesn &apos;t have to have perfect color uniformity ; it can even have a pixel or two missing ; it doesn &apos;t have to be that bright .
And the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down , and that is why I said seven to 10 million there .
When you open it up , it is going to go &quot; bing ; &quot; it &apos;ll be on ; it &apos;ll use it ;
We can put anything we want into it , and it doesn &apos;t get heavier , and then we can take anything out .
Well , if you print it out , it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you are carrying around all the time .
So when I was little , my dad would sit me down at night and he would say , &quot; I am going to teach you about time and space in the future . &quot; And I said , &quot; Great . &quot; And he said one day , &quot; What is the shortest distance between two points ? &quot; And I said , &quot; Well , that is a straight line . You told me that yesterday . &quot; I thought I was very clever .
Bring it over here and open it up . Aaaah !
Let me turn the trails on , so you can see that a little bit better .
It had occurred on land , in rainforests of South America and Africa , where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down .
So I went to Conservation International and brought them in as a partner and went through the process of valuing the fishery resource , deciding how much Kiribati should be compensated , what the range of the fish were , brought in a whole bunch of other partners -- the government of Australia , the government of New Zealand , the World Bank .
Many , many steps were taken to pull this off .
And I &apos;ll leave you with one final slide , that is : how do we scale this up ?
And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas .
And other people go and fill them in .
So I said , &quot; Great . &quot; So I called him up a few weeks afterward .
Man : I won &apos;t send any more commandos in until I know it is safe .
Rayan reframed the situation and brought himself down to my level .
Let me point them out .
So let &apos;s filter that out .
It has a magnetic quality that draws me in .
Once you figure this out , you can really impress people at parties .
If you dress it up with atoms , hydrogen atoms -- that ’ s what it looks like when you have it on your computer -- but actually it ’ s sort of more like this , in the sense that the atoms have a certain sphere that you cannot penetrate . They repel .
If it does , you put the glass down , you go to a different bar .
And the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin , and you smooth it out ,
We hunted them down wherever they were .
You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface .
OK , so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors , because it is incredibly difficult , A , for these things to become -- to be -- preserved , and secondly , for them to have been brought back up to the surface .
It is our ability to write things down , our language and our consciousness .
assuming it was roughly the size of my wife &apos;s hand , I made some measurements of her thumb , and I scaled them out to the size of the skull .
I blew it up to the actual size , and I began using that , along with all the other reference that I had , comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be , exactly how long , etc.
I wasn &apos;t thinking about a dodo skeleton ; I just noticed that as I finished this skull , the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be .
And so button by button , vertebrae by vertebrae , I built my way down .
This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted , and I replicated every last bone and put it in .
I was able to scan the picture , blow it up to exactly full size .
So what I did was , again , like I did with the dodo skull , I blew all my reference up to full size , and then I began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references .
So I took Sculpey , and I built a big block of it , and I passed it through until , you know , I got the right profiles .
My preference is about 70 coats of this -- matte black auto primer . I spray it on for about three or four days , it drips to hell , but it allows me a really , really nice gentle sanding surface and I can get it glass-smooth .
Here , I am going to put it out there , later on tonight , and
I want you to pick it up and handle it .
There is my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon , because I had to get it back out of the mold . There is my first casting , there is my master and there is my bronze .
And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one , it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch .
I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make which I will polish , then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in bronze . Or : There are several people who own originals , and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them , hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds , maybe to take a picture , or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box , and could maybe , without even touching their bird , I swear , get a perfect 3D scan . And I am even willing to sign pages saying that I &apos;ll never let anyone else have it , except for me in my office , I promise .
I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were longer than this room , pumping out so much light that I could read the dials and gauges inside the suit without a flashlight ; and puffs and billows of what looked like luminous blue smoke ; and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters -- just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire , but these were icy , blue embers .
He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals ; one , the enzyme , he called luciferase ; the substrate , he called luciferin after Lucifer the Lightbearer .
And then when it is not using it , it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your Lamborghini .
We capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible that allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition , bring it into the lab on the ship .
Because one of the things that is frustrated me as a deep-sea explorer is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about because of the way we explore the ocean .
Ironically , that object was made by the Killarney process , which is a brand-new process here for the 21st century , and I can hear Greg Lynn laughing his socks off as I say that .
They are fitted like Formula One . You take them off your wall .
You plug them in . Off you jolly well go .
If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town , people will move there .
archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they won &apos;t know about defensive medicine and stuff , but they &apos;ll see all these labels , &quot; Contents are extremely hot . &quot;
If someone brings a lawsuit over , &quot; A kid fell off the seesaw , &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter what happens in the lawsuit , all the seesaws will disappear .
They almost brought the entire financial system down .
Or if they do have our interests at heart , we worry that they don &apos;t know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests .
So these are little ordinary , everyday heroes , and they are incredibly admirable , but there is no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down .
It grows up into the adult stage like that and then goes through a Benjamin Button phase , and actually goes backwards and backwards until it is like a little embryo again , and then actually grows back up , and back down and back up -- sort of yo-yo -- and it never dies .
And we put them in , and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation .
And I am starting this at a mutation rate that is so high that , even if you would drop a replicating program that would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire world , if you drop it in , it gets mutated to death immediately .
But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players .
What turns me on about the digital age , what excites me personally , is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing .
Well , I turned him down .
And it was a funny kind of sick feeling , but I turned him down .
And deep down , if we really accepted that africans were equal to us , we would all do more to put the fire out .
And let me say this without a trace of irony -- before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies .
People are starting to figure this out .
We can &apos;t afford to be cool and sit this one out .
We need to get the math ; we need to get the statistics out to the American people .
And the proper translation of &quot; cogito ergo sum &quot; is &quot; I shake things up , therefore I am . &quot;
Metaphor shakes things up , giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process .
We started with , you can take it off in the office .
And then after that , you can take it off on assignments .
And just because of someone &apos;s hunch , I wasn &apos;t going to give it up .
Because , despite their problems , I had spent my whole life training my lungs , and I was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up .
Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater .
Anchor : He offers no hope of cleaning it up .
And I began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them , using the so-called arborist climbing technique , with ropes . You use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree .
And in the last two to three summers , these invasive organisms , this kind of Ebola of the trees , as it were , has swept through the primeval Hemlock forest of the east , and has absolutely wiped it out . I climbed there this past summer .
So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
How do you actually track them down ?
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address : unionseek.com / d / ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
The local police don &apos;t act , or if they do , there is not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down .
Different people trade off between standing by their outcome , faithfully holding to it , going down in a blaze of glory , or giving it up , putting their finger in the wind , and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position . Most people fall in between , and if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them to change their behavior .
I love that you put it out there .
I got very nervous halfway through the talk though , just panicking whether you had included in your model , the possibility that putting this prediction out there might change the result .
because if you leave for two minutes , it is like you &apos;ve been gone for six months when you show back up again five minutes later , right ?
for two reasons : so there is more of you to give -- and achieve too , we all want to do it -- but I mean give , because that is what is going to fill you up . And secondly , so you can appreciate -- not just understand , that is intellectual , that is the mind -- but appreciate what is driving other people .
and now they are passing it on to me .
Since the dawn of human history , we &apos;ve tried to rectify this imbalance by making art , writing poems , singing songs , scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper , gossipping with friends . This is nothing new .
Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up .
And you &apos;ll see that it leads with a shifting star field , and there is an Aurora Borealis in the background , kind of morphing with color . The color of the Aurora Borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom , and we &apos;ll put it down here to red .
And I can turn them all on , and you can see them moving across the sky now .
So if you have the opportunity , please try it out .
So it gained some traction , and we are trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes , but also , perhaps in the future , in a more clinical situation .
For 20 seconds he is going like that , and all of a sudden it lights up up here .
So we &apos;ve got motor cortex activation up there .
It was kind of hard to get it in .
And I expected them to put a ruler next to the wall , size it up with a finger , and make an estimate of the height .
The standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence , full of a strange kind of energy -- inflationary energy -- which blew it up .
The gap is very tiny , and I &apos;ve blown it up so you can see it .
So I am not the first to figure this out . This is a quote from Brian Eno : &quot; the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them . &quot;
And I &apos;ll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides .
But the point that I want to make -- I &apos;ll show you up here .
That means you , your neighbor , your cellphone , the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it down to the size of the Schwarzschild radius .
So , if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube , it would become a black hole , because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius .
So , if I were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford , it would become a black hole .
So , if a star starts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the Sun , it is going to end its life by exploding and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here .
I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius .
If you &apos;d loan me your Gulfstream , I &apos;ll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt .
Lil Demon : ♫ Step your game up . Oh . Oh . ♫ ♫ Step your game up . Oh . Oh . ♫ Chris Anderson : So , that was sent to me by this man , a filmmaker , Jonathan Chu , who told me that was the moment he realized the Internet was causing dance to evolve .
It is not as if J.J. and Jill actually ended their talks saying , &quot; Step your game up , &quot; but they might as well have .
But the desire element is really dialled way up .
But even leaving the screen out of it , there is still a lot more being transferred than just words .
They help me plan out the whole piece , and then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas , because then you have to think .
JL : Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them ?
I found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four-word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks .
It had sucked all that power up from the localities .
And the fishermen would tie a net off the headland , string it out along the other net .
And then they &apos;d tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbor , boil them up , use the oil .
They even put a recipe up on the wall , until they were told this was illegal .
And I remembered -- I used to spend a lot of time out on commercial fishing boats -- I remember fishermen telling me they can always tell when a basking shark has been caught in the net because it leaves this black slime behind .
So I scraped it off .
So I scraped the slime off and I sent it off to Aberdeen .
And keep an eye out for sharks .
And when he did , Michael , the archangel , was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels .
So they are going to put pressure on these soldiers , military police , to cross the line , give them permission to break the will of the enemy , to prepare them for interrogation , to soften them up , to take the gloves off . Those are the euphemisms , and this is how it was interpreted .
And it should not have escaped you that the reason I paired the prisoner with his arms out with Leonardo da Vinci &apos;s ode to humanity is that that prisoner was mentally ill .
So they , right there , you know , they took me out the door , they put my hands against the car .
He was the one that stopped those abuses you saw , because when he saw those images , he turned them over to a senior investigating officer .
A half an inch would have taken his head off .
But I suspected there was something really important about this whole feminism thing , so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom &apos;s bookshelves and picking books off and reading them -- never , of course , admitting that I was doing so .
We walk across graduation stages , high on our overblown expectations , and when we float back down to earth , we realize we don &apos;t know what the heck it means to actually save the world anyway .
We &apos;ve cluttered ourselves up with all this .
So when you think about it , we are almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there .
And so after admitting I couldn &apos;t see to HR , they sent me off to an eye specialist .
This is the back of Boston City Hall , the most important , you know , significant civic building in Albany -- excuse me -- in Boston . And what is the message that is coming , what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming , from this building and how is it informing us about who we are ?
We know that little Skippy is loading his uzuses down here , getting ready for homeroom .
We know that Heather , his sister Heather , 14 years old , is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit .
You know , but there is obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out , that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver .
Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived , and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around .
So he unties Odysseus , and Odysseus flips out .
This repeats itself through the night -- rehearsal , tying to the mast , conning his way out of it , beating the poor first mate up mercilessly .
You are putting yourself , you are binding yourself , and you are weaseling your way out of it , and then you are beating yourself up afterwards .
And slowly , slowly we are bringing it up to a moderate savings rate .
I remember sometime during the &apos;80s , the mid- &apos;80s , Dick and I and Sidney Coleman would meet a couple of times up in San Francisco at some very rich guy &apos;s house -- up in San Francisco for dinner .
Feynman decided , as a sort of amateur helium physicist , that he would try to figure it out .
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer , mocked it up in cardboard , we &apos;d come in and cut , decide things were wrong , pull it out , put it back in .
This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream .
Next time you are about to throw out an appliance , don &apos;t throw it out .
This happens about the same time that they get latched onto things like dinosaurs , these big things in the outside world that they are trying to get a grip on .
I can &apos;t grind it up in a blender .
So what we are going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young , healthy pig , strip it of its antigens , load it with your stem cells , then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee , tack it on there , have you heal that surface and then create a new biologic surface for your knee .
The things that interest me when I am working are visual structure , surprise and anything that requires figuring things out .
So then I can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves ,
from 2005 and 2006 . And I started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person .
And I drew each person their own unique valentine and put their name on it and numbered it and signed it and sent it out .
Just in the way that I am inspired by books and magazines of all kinds , conversations I have , movies , so I also think , when I put visual work out there into the mass media , work that is interesting , unusual , intriguing , work that maybe opens up that sense of inquiry in the mind , that I am seeding the imagination of the populace .
Because I have some limited time , I &apos;ll cut it off for a second , and tell you about how it works and what it is good for .
Turn it on ; turn it off .
I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer in my attic at my house , and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design I drew way back when .
getting it over there ?
And so I give this out to thousands of people .
And later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy , he pulled it out and said , &quot; And people at MIT , they give out periodic tables . &quot;
And through a process of selection evolution , you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you &apos;d like it to do , like grow a battery or grow a solar cell .
And what we &apos;ve been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye-absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna , and you get an energy transfer across the virus .
You decide when you want to turn something on .
And so we tend to fill these times up when things should really go really quickly .
And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience , and someone else can pick it up at their convenience .
You take a 10 or 20 percent commission , and then you -- the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission , and passes the rest over to you in cash .
We feel regret when we think we are responsible for a decision that came out badly , but almost came out well .
So the very first week we were working , we got the price down to 500 dollars .
We negotiated it down to 190 .
She and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country .
We are now working with partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda and our Foundation folks to scale this system up .
So as part of organizing this and whatever , this commemoration , the police will round us up as they call us leaders .
It can change your workflow -- actually , it can change everything in your company ; it can turn your company upside down .
So they basically put a map up on the wall , threw a dart , and it landed at a senior home here in Colorado .
But for me , I was an adult and it was embarrassing , and I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips , and capture the air and get the word out .
So one of the seniors just came up to me , and she pushed me up to the corner and she said , When you think it is time to go , just stick the cane out there .
And he took me up to the temples in Nikko .
Seven of them are exactly the same , and the eighth one is turned upside down .
And I said to Professor Kurokawa , &quot; Wow , the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they had made a mistake and put this one upside down . &quot;
So , I wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the Alhambra .
I could rotate it by a third of a turn , or a half a turn , or put it back down on its image , or two thirds of a turn .
But what I could do is just leave it where it is , pick it up , and put it down again .
Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry where I just pick it up and leave it where it is .
How many things can I do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube ?
But let &apos;s go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects .
Okay , I am going to sort you out .
If there had been rational technology assessment then , I think they very well might have said , &quot; Let &apos;s call the whole thing off . &quot; Even now , our choices are having unintended effects .
And OK , so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac , you know , but really it is the kind of same old crap we &apos;ve had for the last , you know , 30 years .
or you know , flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards .
Or if you want to be destructive , you can just crumple it up and , you know , toss it to the corner .
Also just like paper , around our workspace we &apos;ll pin things up to the wall to remember them later , and I can do the same thing here , and you know , you &apos;ll see post-it notes and things like that around people &apos;s offices .
And I can pull them off when I want to work with them .
So I can pile things up , I can flip through it , I can , you know -- okay , let &apos;s move this photo to the back , let &apos;s delete this guy here , and I think it is just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information .
And when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies .
And you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them ,
And the reality is that the further away you are from that , you are a few microseconds behind every time . These guys down on Wall Street , Marco Polo and Cherokee Nation , they are eight microseconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out up around the Carrier Hotel .
And two tools helped bring the death rate down . One was killing the mosquitoes with DDT . The other was treating the patients with quinine , or quinine derivatives .
And we &apos;ve done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it , to raise the average capability -- or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system .
And that allows us to understand who is doing it well , and call them out , and find out what those techniques are .
I &apos;ve had some time to think it over .
Now , if you look at what that adjacent property is worth , you could actually buy the property , cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line , and then sell it off again .
So let me back up a little bit .
We &apos;ve made a good job . We &apos;ve taken it out .
We can tell in the operating room , in the field , at a molecular level , where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out .
You have to cut it out , bring it back home , cut it up , look inside and say , &quot; Oh yes , it does have gas . &quot; So that takes more time .
If we could turn them off , then we could try and figure out what they are necessary for .
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about .
But we activate targets in the brain , different ones , using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide , in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear .
Now over the last couple of years , we &apos;ve gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off .
So this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light , and we beam light in , and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure , we are hoping to be able to turn it off .
And by turning things off , it is more or less a zero .
If you look at the x-axis of this graph , you &apos;ll see that what we commonly want to do -- which is keeping the outdoors out -- we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation .
And the model that we are working with in hospitals , and also with many , many different buildings , is to keep the outdoors out .
He is analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he is tracking .
I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide of the Mola mola fish .
This is -- I put it down at the bottom , but that was extemporaneous , obviously .
So we &apos;ve designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million .
And the Chinese government has now -- I work with the Chinese government now -- has taken this up .
So we need materials in closed cycles , but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million for cancer , birth defects , mutagenic effects , disruption of our immune systems , biodegradation , persistence , heavy metal content , knowledge of how we are making them and their production and so on .
We have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing , and we are releasing this database into the public in six weeks . So designers all over the world can analyze their products down to the parts per million for human and ecological health .
And they brought us in and said , &quot; What would you do ? &quot;
We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure .
We &apos;ve lifted the earth up onto the roofs .
This is the area where primary auditory processing -- so you are hearing my words , you are sending it up into higher language processing centers .
So we sent our lab technician out .
We take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray .
They don &apos;t even have to log in to come use this tool , mine this data , find interesting things out with this .
So drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off , etc.
But I want to turn that upside down for a moment , and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say .
OK , swap them around , put your right hand up .
KB : OK , I am just going to take it off . You are OK , you are OK .
KB : No , no , you are fine , you are fine , take it off . You are OK . You are safe .
Now , I am going to give you some demonstrations up here , live , right now .
I need two people to help me out real quick .
Now , it is very important for everybody here to realize I haven &apos;t set anything up with you guys .
KB : Twice . OK , extend your left arm out in front of you .
Now , what I want you to do is look directly at me , OK , just take a deep breath in through your nose , letting it out through your mouth , and relax .
And I want you to hold it there , just for a moment , and I only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness , and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop .
Now , hold it out here .
OK , drop it in .
KB : OK , Steve , come on up here .
They just , they insist that because I was a magician , put a nice , black tablecloth on .
SJ : Put this on ?
Don &apos;t stack them up , OK .
I &apos;ll put the blindfold on .
OK , go ahead , mix them up .
Psychologists , figure this out .
But knowing that molecule is valuable , because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off .
opens it up and there is a pearl necklace inside .
Of course , if you don &apos;t like to touch people , I can always shove this up your nose .
And it is like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don &apos;t turn the thing off .
And , you know , we open it up and I read the music .
and it is amazing that when you do open your body up , and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through , that in fact the tiny , tiny difference ...
And so what I did is I took it , I translated it into English , and I stuck it up for my friends to use .
looking at dinosaur evolution and studying it , digging it up for many years , I end up looking at the mammal radiation , and it seems as though everything is quick time , just like technology , advancing by an order of magnitude .
We now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size -- we are going to see where they began in a minute -- and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats I just told you that dinosaurs weren &apos;t in .
You &apos;ve got to dig a hole that is usually quite a bit bigger than that to get it out ; you &apos;ve got to climb those cliffs and find , really , everything that existed -- not just the dinosaurs , but the entire story . If you are lucky , and you dig a place like that , you actually find the ash bed to dig it , and we did .
It is an impressive track record , and so we look back and we say , well , we didn &apos;t really exactly work this out theoretically from the start , but when we look back , there are theoretical movements in science education .
Because the challenge is not losing weight , it is actually keeping it off .
And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today called Playtime Computing that is really trying to think about how we can take what is so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child , where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play .
Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport , but she decided she &apos;d go for broke and try for one last big payday in the marquee event , the New York City Marathon .
In that very short learning curve , you guys have gone from broken organs up to the fact that you are only 10 minutes off the male world record .
is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up ?
He pissed me off . Let him go chase his own antelope .
but by the time we &apos;ve made her up and put wigs and makeup on , she looks exactly like Marilyn , to the extent that her husband couldn &apos;t recognize her -- or recognize this look-alike -- in these photographs , which I find quite interesting .
But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on , you are closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product and that is all you are doing .
When we do it , we will put the cost of care down .
You have another horse , where maybe the horseshoer beat him up
And if you bring them in for internships in your companies , the thing about the autism , Asperger-y kind of mind , you &apos;ve got to give them a specific task . Don &apos;t just say , &quot; Design new software . &quot;
And about three years ago , I started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open-source software community to create new digital tools for magic -- tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster .
We try to avoid blowing ourselves up .
But we really made sure we tested those Rovers before we got them down -- or that Rover -- and made sure that it is all working well .
Rob Grover : Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft , and we use the friction when it is flying through the atmosphere to our advantage to slow us down .
EB : And then it has to light up its engines , right itself , and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely .
We are coming at extremely high speeds , and we are deploying them to slow us down . So we have to do all kinds of tests .
Actually , the lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover above that surface for 100 feet , and then we have a sky crane which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface .
My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap ; half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar .
We &apos;ve got to pick you up .
and I could see again , vividly , the camera flashbulbs going off , the paparazzuses , the autograph hunters , the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal .
So for some reason , this was what I wanted to have a crack at , but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece , let alone make it across to Canada , I had to take a radical approach .
The next bit , we had chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga , which was the sort of last bit of civilization .
Finally , morning of day 11 , we got the all-clear , loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem -- dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice .
All I could think about was running back up to the door , banging on the door , and saying , &quot; Look guys , I haven &apos;t quite thought this through . &quot;
To make things worse , you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen ; that is a full moon .
I got up in the morning , took the tent down , ski&apos;d north for seven-and-a-half hours , put the tent up , and I was two and a half miles further back than when I had started .
When you get lots of mist , low cloud , the wind starts blowing the snow up .
Strange mixture of feelings : it was extremely warm by this stage , a lot of open water around , and of course , elated that I had got there under my own steam , but starting to really realize that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada , which was still 400 miles away , were slim at best .
took a few photos . I got my satellite phone out .
I warmed the battery up in my armpit .
We &apos;d like to pick you up .
I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed -- a pretty emotional moment .
He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front , and I climbed in the back .
That is as close as I can come to summing that up .
Would we have thrown him out then ?
We were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection .
It was someone &apos;s birthday , and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail , and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues .
So , in Indonesia at this time , if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up , they could put you into jail .
Now , the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well-known , bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher .
Then it came way down . And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex -- and in drug users , you &apos;ve really got nothing much going on after treatment begins , and that is because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier .
We are not all of them , of course , but TED is a community of opinion leaders . And everyone who is in this room , and everyone who is watching this out there on the web , I think , has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense .
And I &apos;d pull her out on the front porch .
They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up .
She pulled the car over ; she said , &quot; Get out of the car . &quot;
My mom grabbed us by the shoulders . She marched us out in the field .
I set it up with the foreman . I set it up with the owner of the land .
Fifteen years ago , 14 years ago , I guess , this year , my wife and I lost our daughter , Sarah Jane , in a car accident , and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world .
Sometimes I think it is better just to sink way down in your funky mood &apos;til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues .
We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard .
They said they were going to beat us up if we didn &apos;t make some gunpowder for them .
They said , we are going to melt it down and make rocket fuel .
It is going to really hurt if I don &apos;t take that off . Okay .
Quite the similar idea , then , a perfume packaged in a book , in a die cut . So I decided to close it down for one year .
And I thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years .
He closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff .
So I am not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up .
We put a mask on it , looked at it deep down in the ground , checked it out from all sides , west , north , south , east , top and bottom .
While we built all this up during that week , with the 100 volunteers , a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it .
And they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters .
They went out and gathered them up .
So this was a problem , and Peter Dodson pointed this out using some duck-billed dinosaurs then called Hypacrosaurus .
It is unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out .
But if you line them up , if you just take those three skulls and just line them up , they line up like this .
Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space , architecture is nothing but a special-effects machine that delights and disturbs the senses .
And then , this is a view going up , and then you could come into the theater , which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop .
I just , can I just say a few things about , first about Cherie , because she is a wonderful lady , my wife , with a wonderful smile .
He summed it up , really , at a dinner .
&quot; But I have a message for the suicide bombers , for those people who &apos;ve blown themselves up . &quot;
And he and the Chief Justice , they trip over each other , they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up .
And so we set it up , and we called ourselves the G7 .
We are interested in using DNA , RNA and protein , and building new languages for building things from the bottom up , using biomolecules , potentially having nothing to do with biology .
We heat them up , we add a little bit of salt , we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down , and as we cool them down , the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure . And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there .
I mixed them up , heated them , cooled them down , and I got 50 billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water .
So , you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface , and we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope .
They took a DNA origamuses , organized some carbon nano-tubes , made a little switch , you see here , wired it up , tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch .
If you can pull this off , you will be a global hero .
I am boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order to plot this out .
He picks up a spoon , picks it up , scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk , holds the spoon level as he translates it , moving all these joints simultaneously , to his mouth , and he doesn &apos;t drop any milk .
After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design , and we &apos;d have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make -- you can always get three out of four of anything you want ; the weight , the size , the cost , the functionality -- I put a bunch of guys in my plane and I said , We are flying down to Walter Reed , and we are going talk to these kids ,
They were tough questions . There is polarized groups down there .
So , I got my hands on that chemical , filled the sink up with it , and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in , which was really impossible .
And I learnt how to slow my heart rate down .
Then I learnt that you have to take a huge breath , and just hold and relax and never let any air out , and just hold and relax through all the pain .
I wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if I could slow my heart rate down under duress .
The world record was eight minutes and 58 seconds , held by Tom Sietas , that guy with the whale lungs I told you about .
And by seven minutes and 30 seconds they had to pull my body out and bring me back .
So , he pulled me up , and I was fine .
So , he suddenly pushed the record up to 16 minutes and 32 seconds .
Luckily Kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up .
And there is no way to slow my heart rate down .
I spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down .
So , at 16 minutes what I did is I slid my feet out because I knew that if I did go out , if I did have a heart attack , they &apos;d have to jump into the binding and take my feet out
before pulling me up . So , I was really nervous .
So , I let my feet out , and I started floating to the top . And I didn &apos;t take my head out .
And then I &apos;ll let you in on a secret , which is why I am an incurable optimist .
In other words , the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed .
They put them about one inch above the ground , and then they shut everything off and they go pfft .
The wires are already in its body , and they can just hook it up to their technology , and now they &apos;ve got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance .
He took owl monkeys , wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved , especially looking at the movement of their right arm .
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm , which you see here in the picture , put the arm in another room .
It is living -- fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides , attached photosensitive sensors to the brain , put it into a cart -- here is the cart , the brain is sitting there in the middle -- and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart , when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart , the cart moves toward the light ; when you turn it off , it moves away .
Finally , not that long ago , Craig Venter created the first artificial cell , where he took a cell , took a DNA synthesizer , which is a machine , created an artificial genome , put it in a different cell -- the genome was not of the cell he put it in -- and that cell then reproduced as the other cell .
And it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water .
But , one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood .
So , we pushed the piles down through the dune , and we create an initial bacterial surface .
We then pull the piles up through the dune and we are able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up .
And I realized that if I scaled them up , they would provide me with good spatial qualities , for ventilation , for thermal comfort , and for other things .
My design , as it takes you down the rabbit hole , is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world .
When I say it out loud , it sounds so ridiculous , but I can only come to the conclusion that it was what , in the alien abductee community , they call a &quot; screen memory &quot; : a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma -- say , of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid .
Neither did the Liberians , although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back , and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street , holding hands .
I put half the lab up in my house .
And when it dies , it falls to the bottom and then it rots , which means that bacteria break it down .
They kick them out , and then they die .
As the surface of the ocean gets warmer , the water is lighter when it is warmer , it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over .
And , at the same time , water from the surface , which is rich in oxygen , doesn &apos;t make it down and the ocean turns into a desert .
Here is another one -- completely different one : Why is it that we don &apos;t do the blindingly obvious things we should do to combat climate change , very , very simple things like buying energy-efficient appliances , putting in efficient lights , turning the lights off occasionally , insulating our homes ?
So , you might be wondering why it is that , every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill , we call these CEOs down to Washington , and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them .
We put it in . There was a tremendous banditry problem .
Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks and put herself out , to compete in the Poet of the Millions competition .
but by putting the issues out there , they are influencing the presidential race .
And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up , listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy , and then committing myself a hundred percent -- there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind -- and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water .
28 great , big , powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain -- I don &apos;t just have my Speedo ,
Many , many people have died on Mt . Everest , and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain .
And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later .
And that is in fact probably what I am going to try and tell you about .
We set them off on this air hockey table .
Now , hopefully , those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that , and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure , and in fact , you know , I can now take a dog , carve it up and then reassemble it so it is a linear string that will fold from a sequence . And now I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits .
Now you &apos;ve finished the lens , you literally pop it out .
We look at where the emissions are coming from -- they are coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth , and we say , okay , well the problem is that they are coming out of fossil fuels that we are burning , so therefore , the answer must be to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy . And while , of course , we do need clean energy , I would put to you that it is possible that by looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem , we are in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it . And the reason why is that we live on a planet that is rapidly urbanizing .
And when you layer that over with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we are starting to see , what you find is , in fact , even more access suffused into spaces .
And I can find United States up there .
They started very well . They used the aid well .
This is actually just a picture of the earth at night , and I am just putting it up because I think it is pretty .
And to ask that question -- happy is not a word I use very much -- we &apos;ve had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy .
For outside the safety of the park were poachers , who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks .
You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down .
We can turn the volume up a little bit if that is available .
Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that I &apos;ll talk a little bit about .
And it is kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse , except that you are now running a string of these things down .
We calculate gradient surfaces , and drive the bot over to a wall where there is a high probability of life .
You can dive into the stratosphere , and precisely dissipate that velocity , and come back out to the space station .
And you see , there is a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen , trying to figure it out
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using , a ceremony they hadn &apos;t used in about 29 years . And it was to send some men -- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses .
And &quot; remarkable &quot; is a really cool word because we think it just means neat , but it also means -- worth making a remark about .
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out .
But that is due to natural predators like vultures that pick them off on a beach or predatory fish that are waiting offshore .
I actually jumped in and photographed this , and with the fisherman &apos;s permission , I cut the turtle out , and it was able to swim free .
This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida .
I &apos;ll just run them very quickly through .
Great . Now , those over 25 , could you put your hands up if you are wearing your wristwatch ?
He said , &quot; He was in a car wreck , and I pulled him out , gave him CPR , and I saved his wife &apos;s life as well . &quot;
thinking it through , I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator .
The whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead .
And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh where I filled out a college application and got in on probation .
And last year I spoke at his memorial service and wished him well in this life .
We have since spun him off into his own business .
This was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building -- and so I had another cardboard box built and I walked back out in the streets again .
I appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody &apos;s expectations and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year ,
So , I called him up on the phone and I said , &quot; Mr . Skoll , I &apos;ve come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are and I &apos;d like to become your friend . &quot;
And the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment , they grow to twice their size , they cut themselves down in the middle , and one cell becomes two , and so on and so on .
They cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy .
They digest our food , they make our vitamins , they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out .
We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room , and this is what we see .
We know that the principles and the rules , if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms , the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well .
You can just call it out .
Aging is ghastly , but it is inevitable , so , you know , we &apos;ve got to find some way to put it out of our minds , and it is rational to do anything that we might want to do , to do that .
Well , it seems to get the point across .
The engineering approach simply says , &quot; Let &apos;s go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -- not necessarily repair them completely , but repair them quite a lot , so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist , that causes it to be pathogenic . &quot;
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible .
It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay .
Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us ?
External debt -- something that I can tell you a long story about because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent -- has come down dramatically .
I don &apos;t think that africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid .
Why I don &apos;t mind if we get aid , but we use it well .
And then they toweled her down because she started sweating , which was a good sign .
You know , we have to use it well .
Well , why don &apos;t we first say to those helping us out , Don &apos;t be shy about infrastructure .
So I am saying that one of the takeaways from here -- I am not saying the men are not important -- obviously , if you leave the husbands out , what will they do ?
And I &apos;ve broken it down into four-bar groups here , so you would know how you would trade .
Mos Def : ♫ ... brown skin I be , standing five-ten I be ♫ ♫ Rockin &apos;it when I be , in your vicinity ♫ ♫ Whole-style synergy , recognize symmetry ♫ ♫ Go and try to injure me , broke &apos;em down chemically ♫ ♫ Ain &apos;t the number 10 MC , talk about how been I be ♫ ♫ styled it like Kennedy , late like a 10 to three ♫ ♫ When I say when I be , girls say bend that key cut ♫ CL : And so there is a lot of analogy between what takes place in free-style rap and jazz .
Moore &apos;s law made computing cheap ; so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect and decide thumbs up or thumbs down .
Next we can actually light them up with a laser .
I mean , here we are blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down .
If you can see this orange tree , it is actually growing in a car tire , which has been turned inside out and sewn up .
What I needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people .
Ham and I took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome , but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand .
We narrowed it down to one fragment ;
The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we &apos;ve done -- asking for ethical review , pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side -- this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community , in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government .
So when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out , we think we can shorten that process quite substantially .
So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand , put it down , turn around , and go back in .
On one day , it &apos;ll all be here , and then the next day they &apos;ll move it over there , and then they &apos;ll move it back .
When the foragers come in with food , they just drop it into the upper chamber , and other ants come up from below , get the food , bring it back , husk the seeds , and pile them up .
And once they belong to the ants that work outside , they never go back down .
And the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out , and what it does when it comes back out .
They would take a ship down to Panama , across the isthmus , and then take another ship north . This guy , Dr . Toland , went by covered wagon to California . This has its parallels , too . doctors leaving their practices .
This is work going on down in lower Manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations .
And they couldn &apos;t yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house .
Then there should always be in sight the draw -- a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth to finish the process of getting there .
Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring .
It runs on solar , and it sends a signal with that antenna and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere to a place in Bozeman , Montana , where the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to San Francisco , where we put the data in real time up on our website .
Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there , and that brings it out .
because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on , and there is a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition , and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park , and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park . That would be swell .
So actually , check this out . Very embarrassing .
So you &apos;ll have to , like , go check it out and come see me or something .
So check this out .
And what I &apos;d like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation , how the will to survive can bring that out in people .
This is a picture of me in that area taken a year before , and you can see I &apos;ve got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather .
All the climbers here are climbing unroped , and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody , you &apos;d wind up just pulling them off with you .
I gave them radio advice from Camp Three , and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power .
So what we did was , we got the victims down to 21,000 feet , where it was easier for me to treat them .
What we did was try to warm them up as best we could , put oxygen on them and try to revive them , which is difficult to do at 21,000 feet , when the tent is freezing .
So , as I was taking care of Beck , he related what had been going on up there .
He is focussing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble .
It was able to land on the ice , take away Beck and the other survivors , one by one , and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp .
Soldier : Bring it on ! Narrator : You ready ? Voice 2 : Iraq , here we come !
How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation ?
Soldiers : Get your vest on !
The way I learnt about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email , and in it , attached a photo of that burned body out at the car .
We got our first panel out on December third .
And this is what I &apos;ll tell you about .
She is turning it inside out .
They knock themselves off .
But you want an interdisciplinary team of people hashing this out , trying to figure out : What is the kind of ownership model , in a digital world , that is going to lead to the most innovation ?
And for a swimmer , you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you .
And after just three minutes in that water , he was able to get himself out .
We are going to actually have to take them off .
Take the goggles off . Take the goggles off !
The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks .
I picked this up at MIT . It is a little younger .
I didn &apos;t know what was going on , but I was so part of the process of getting that out .
And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series .
But she was thrilled to get that out as a real , real fact in her life .
For a young man to really make it out here , you got to think of some negative things and all that , or some kind of vices .
KBI : I am just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won &apos;t affect my face -- the explosion , you know .
When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird , and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when they are photographed or seen in that space .
I couldn &apos;t deal with the success of furniture -- I wasn &apos;t secure enough as an architect -- and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like .
It was a very prominent building off the freeway , and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of -- I thought -- the language of the neighborhood , which had these cornices , projecting cornices .
And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off .
On the side facing the street it is much more normal , except I slipped a few mansards down , so that coming on the point , these housing units made a gesture to the corner .
I just added it so that we &apos;d have enough money in the budget so we could take something out .
In this case we are opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners .
About four years ago I took a team of students down to Haiti , and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there .
And that they could figure it out , that we could sell this stuff to kids .
You know , the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important , we have to teach kids about in school .
These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up , because they haven &apos;t had lunch .
I &apos;ll move it off , and we &apos;ll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you .
This is a horrific image , so I am putting my hand up now .
We then bent a plate up to it .
We are still not reconstructing them well enough .
We put a call out there , and to my surprise in a couple of months we had hundreds of entries from around the world .
So the bullet point -- sorry , I never do a suit , so I knew that I was going to take this off .
So it is dealing with the fact that if you have aids , you also need to have nutrition rates , and the idea that the idea of nutrition is as important as getting anti-retrovirals out there .
And you have to keep the maintenance down .
So when you come to TEDGlobal , you can check it out .
working with residents , getting them out of their homes , so they don &apos;t get ill . This is what they are cleaning up on their own .
We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep .
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
So , you can say like , &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend , I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot;
One blueprint for trouble , making collapse likely , is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term interest of the society as a whole , especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions . Where what is good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole , there is a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run .
Shamelessly cheap is something , I think -- this will wake you up .
I thought I could jazz it up a bit , have a little fun with it .
Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover , in the middle of the night , this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down .
I gave you at least four arguments in favor .
Well , they signed me up immediately .
So , step two , I hold the device up , and then I sight its altitude there so I can see it clearly now .
We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion .
We get so many visitors visiting our lab . So , when the visitors come , mars walks up to the computer , starts typing &quot; Hello , my name is mars . &quot;
I directly run to my home office , sit at my computer , I type in the ideas , I sketch things out and I keep a database of ideas .
Patient : I can &apos;t make it out .
And I called him up and said , &quot; Listen , I ran one race and I won ... &quot;
You pick it up , you put the damn thing back on , and finish the goddamn race !
I tried to get it out of anybody I could , you know , &quot; Who am I running against here ? &quot;
So they call us out and , you know -- &quot; Ladies , you have one minute . &quot; And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd , like , the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see .
And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over , to keep it on . Which , when I sweat , you know , I am pistoning out of it .
And , I mean , it is really -- let me take this off so you can see it .
that need a two-inch heel . I have a three-inch heel . I need a little bit off .
But now you can find out all about -- unfortunately , my weight is a little higher than that , but -- all about what happens .
computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in , that we teach them in , are hideously insensate when it comes to space . They don &apos;t understand real world space .
has to come back out , whatever you put in .
And you can come back out through the scary orangutan .
So we can throw it out like that . Let &apos;s reset it .
So if we don &apos;t like stuff , or we are intensely curious about Ernst Haeckel &apos;s scientific falsifications , we can pull them out like that .
We can grab elements off the front , where upon they reanimate , come to life , and drag them down onto the table here .
We &apos;ll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well .
So , this is actually a key to happiness for me , is to just remember when I came over here , the car didn &apos;t flip over , and I didn &apos;t trip coming up the stairs .
They have a pamphlet that says , &quot; Here is what Jesus said about homosexuality , &quot; and you open it up , and there is nothing in it .
And two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said , &quot; We could do that , &quot;
Meanwhile , the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work , running late , running errands -- want a little slack to pick the kids up late .
We can use it to crack each other up , and we are going to do that .
All along , if you wanted a young cricketer , you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality , your own city , and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers .
It is like the dictionary ; it is hard to look things up by the third letter .
It is very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we &apos;ve seen tornadoes devastating cities , or some poor schmuck who is blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July .
I have to show you something from my own lab , so let me sneak this in .
So would you drive to get 50 percent off , saving 100 dollars ?
It doesn &apos;t know what you saved it on .
This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond , which is , people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher than the subjective value of 60 when they &apos;ll be delivered in now or one month , respectively -- a 30-day delay -- but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year .
Watch what happens when we drop some out .
And if we wanted to zoom into a page , we can just open it up .
And if you want to go back and read the book again , you just fold it back up and put it back on the page .
And so this works the same way ; you pick it up and pop it open .
Mike Matas : And so throughout the whole book , Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos .
♫ We don &apos;t need no more trouble ♫ Get that idiot out !
and he pulled it off .
He gets up there and then he ... comes back up .
September 11 generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero ,
People put buckets out ...
RSW : Well , I am going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it has been very long .
And the first thing I did , which was sort of in the absence of another idea , was say I &apos;ll sort of write it out and make some words big , and I &apos;ll have some kind of design on the back somehow , and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something .
and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and I pasted them down on an ugly board . I thought that something would come out of it , like &quot; words rule fantastic new old first last Pope &quot; because it is by Alexander Pope , but I sort of made a mess out of it , and then I thought I &apos;d repeat it in some way so it was legible .
Now I am seeing lots of smirks out there .
You know , we are the smartest thing out there , why can &apos;t we figure this out ?
And of course , if we are put in environments where we can &apos;t deal with it , in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up .
What we need is a population that is basically smart , can make lots of decisions , but doesn &apos;t have access to any of the systems we have , any of the things that might mess us up -- no human technology , human culture , maybe even not human language .
You know , she is a smart , very cut creature , a primate as well , but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up .
So we said , well , maybe we should just , actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money .
But very quickly , the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food .
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own .
When they get a hankering for some treats , we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market .
And I am seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there .
You can &apos;t just shut that off .
The hope is that you all will think about your limitations , not necessarily as unovercomable , but to recognize them , accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out .
And thinking that , can an individual actually do something , or come up with something , that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference ?
But as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt that it wouldn &apos;t catch on out there , that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career .
and if it wasn &apos;t for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations , I would have never made this body of work .
So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms .
So they &apos;ll put 20 or 40 up at a time , and they just go up in the same way as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area .
And they don &apos;t want to let me in .
And it isn &apos;t something that isn &apos;t just affecting our world , but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down -- but there is a growing footprint that is happening in Asia , and is growing at a rapid , rapid rate , and so I don &apos;t think we can equalize it . So ultimately the strategy , I think , here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution ,
it hasn &apos;t sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out . Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements , about how to change our world in a better way , quickly .
And what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text , and the text is blasted all over .
And this one is : I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas on , and invent ideas on , sustainability .
And one of the things that came out -- Allison , who actually nominated me , said something earlier on in a brainstorming . She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six .
And they are going to push that up , from the bottom -- up into , I believe , into the households . And parents will be reacting to it , and trying to help them with the projects .
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail .
In fact , you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing , and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed , except that daddy messed it up .
And the challenge , really , is to pull the global average up here .
And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory , systems engineers , where they create feedback loops , put the right information at the right point of time .
You put a smart meter in your home , and you see how much electricity you are using right now , how much it is costing you , your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly .
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it .
And I sat them down , and I got them glasses of water -- OK , I got it . I got them glasses of water .
Because I was , sort of , upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story , but the truth was , I hadn &apos;t really thought this through , so I backpedalled a little and I said , Well , what exactly do you mean by righteous ?
I needed something that would pull me out of all this .
I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out , and I would not allow cancer to ride me .
I needed an anchor , an image , a peg to peg this process on , so that I could go from there .
I wrote the code and put it out there .
Second rule , if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data using the HTTP protocol from the web , I will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing , about that event . Who is at the event ? Whatever it is about that person , where they were born , things like that .
So , I can go ahead and look that thing up .
Think of the diversity of the web . It is a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there .
And I hope that they will put it up as linked data .
Before I came down here , I looked it up on OpenStreetMap
I had to turn that part of me off . I had to turn that part of me off .
and in a sense , I &apos;ve been reflecting on turning that part of us off .
When we focus on ourselves in any activity , we do turn that part of ourselves off if there is another person .
I had had dinner with her about two years ago and I &apos;d -- she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn &apos;t get it off .
So I suppose you are not going to be able to kick me off the stage , since you asked the question .
So , it all worked out well .
RB : I know , I have -- the lawyers say you mustn &apos;t do things like that , but -- CA : I mean , speaking of which , tell us about -- RB : &quot; Pammy &quot; we launched , you know -- mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola , and we launched a cola bottle called &quot; The Pammy &quot; and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson .
And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds , and about 50 feet , before I hit the sea , threw myself over .
And the balloon hit the sea and went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me .
And I finally worked it all out .
I mean , there is a lot of people in the room who are wealthy , and they &apos;ve got kids , and we &apos;ve got this dilemma about how you bring them up .
You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster .
The night I brought you home , I watched you roll it out .
I would always have to work myself up to this question , because I am not a psychologist . I don &apos;t work with people in any kind of traumatic situation .
An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw , and she throws her hands up and she says , &quot; Wasn &apos;t that wonderful ? &quot;
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world .
You cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit .
Of course you can &apos;t separate this out from issues like social diversity , mass transit , the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance , the quality of civic spaces .
Now , what we need is , we need people who will be able to scale them up .
This is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago , which is the reason I bring him up now , because it is kind of an anniversary year .
And we can actually leave it out where it is not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness .
Nobody would want to give them up .
Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty , how best we release their energies .
On the one hand , we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out .
You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha , where a blogger talked about how you hack , or break into , a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen , and it spread all over . Kryptonite had to adjust the lock , and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns .
He makes enough money , just by running ads , to support his family up in Oregon .
Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant : this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog . And if he knew I was showing this right now -- I put this in today -- he would kill me .
I wrote this one , and I put this up because of Einstein today .
I put the bad pictures up too , because there are bad pictures .
And -- and so I printed out her -- or I sent a PDF of her blog to her family , and they passed it out at her memorial service , and even in her obituary , they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life .
We bring the tuna out , we measure it .
The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is , I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish , because they manage their fisheries well , they are doing a good job .
So what we &apos;ve done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska , met salmon shark on their home territory , followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that , if we take a salmon and put it on a line , we can actually take up a salmon shark -- This is the cousin of the white shark -- and very carefully -- note , I say &quot; very carefully , &quot; -- we can actually keep it calm , put a hose in its mouth , keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag .
These elephant seals cover half an ocean , take data down to 1,800 feet -- amazing data .
So what we are able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots , 4,000 deployments , a huge herculean task , 2,000 tags in an area , shown here for the first time , off the California coast ,
They are carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters .
And then literally just out of nowhere , the guy asks me , &quot; Where were you September 12th ? &quot; And when most of us get asked , &quot; Where were you September 12th ? &quot; or any date for that fact , it is like , &quot; I don &apos;t exactly remember , but I can look it up for you . &quot;
And I was like , &quot; All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo , and here we go all over again . &quot; And there was a sincere concern there .
And I &apos;ll help you out .
So by me putting all this information out there , what I am basically telling you is I am telling you everything .
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out .
And she &apos;d bring them in , and she &apos;d say , This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life .
So they &apos;d take one string and they &apos;d pull it over here and they couldn &apos;t reach the other string .
There is a little ledge inside , so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that .
And when it is finished , you put it vertically , and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line and the water only comes to here -- and so it keeps the tea out . On top of that , it communicates , which is what emotion does .
I am only saying positive things from now on .
If you took the same technology and pilotted it into one of those remote schools , where the score was 30 percent , and , let &apos;s say , took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing .
I took the experiment out to northeastern India , to a village called Madantusi , where , for some reason , there was no English teacher , so the children had not learnt English at all .
And they said , &quot; Well , we &apos;ve picked it up from the CDs . &quot;
Finally , I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable , if they happen everywhere else .
I was exhausted , and I was also disillusioned in a way I couldn &apos;t quite put my finger on .
And I decided to take some time out from work .
I felt -- there is a scene in the Al Pacino movie &quot; The Insider , &quot; which you may know , where he goes back to CBS after they &apos;ve let him down over the tobacco guy , and he goes , &quot; You know , I just can &apos;t do this anymore . Something is broken . &quot; And it was like that for me . I love that movie .
And I gave it up .
And it is a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump . The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today .
You have comfort , irreverence , and social commentary , not only battling it out in our society , but you literally have two establishment shows -- &quot; Gunsmoke &quot; and &quot; Gomer Pyle &quot; -- in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows .
I can vote you off the island .
I am saying we are Homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred .
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window .
Now , I agree that you have to -- yeah , there are certain concessions and , you know , if you use a slide projector , you are not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side , or up or down , but maybe that is an O.K. trade-off , to trade that off for a focus .
I took some photos , and this is a billboard in Florida , and either they hadn &apos;t paid their rent , or they didn &apos;t want to pay their rent again on the sign , and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down , so they just tore out sections of it .
When I got done it was 540 pages , and then the publisher , Gingko Press , ended up cutting it down considerably : it is just under 400 pages now .
The students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night , and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ...
And I reached down and picked him up , and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility .
So I marveled for a moment , and then decided it was time to release him , so I put him down .
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays , and being the spineless guy , I thought , well I &apos;ll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in , and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display .
And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure , forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth , until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals , reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone .
And I just ate it up .
We pass it down from generation to generation .
But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona , was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school ,
I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure .
And when I sat the students down , I said , &quot; Who is got the best one ? &quot;
But perhaps most interesting , to me anyway , and most important , is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression , and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom .
So I am going to put the slide up now . It won &apos;t be up for long .
You see the cells coming back out .
Clearly the images kind of get that across .
Yes , let is just go work this thing out .
Decide which instruments , stock it up with consumables . And currently we are working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site .
And with Al &apos;s blessing , we decided on the spot to turn it into a film , because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having Al go around the world , speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time .
and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets .
That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters with the Colombian cartels and the major Russian crime syndicates ,
hooked it up to my laptop , and within about five minutes he had penetrated the computer security system of a major Brazilian bank .
And what they are planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life , and how he changed our thinking .
I say almost every aspect , because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on .
So if it is going to come and it is going to happen , what is holding it up ?
And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else .
So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say .
And so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me .
They actually have these busses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier .
But what you are going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out .
Face to face would work , but it is hard to set it up .
It is going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice .
A judge would let her out . And he said , Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . What can we do ? So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .
You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners . And I would lift him , and he would put his fingers through .
Or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corrugated , and he would put his fingers through .
send them on if you want to -- they are always welcome .
You know , it is just one point . I mean , maybe she &apos;ll let you in if that slot is still there . So we went to the school , and because we were nobodies , and because we didn &apos;t have privilege , and because my father didn &apos;t have the right last name , he was treated like dirt .
And I am pretty much the one who figured it out , because I was a nerd .
Why did you bring this up ? Have you lost your mind ?
So I looked back up and she said , &quot; are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube ? &quot; And I said , &quot; I am just thinking about it a little bit . &quot; She said , &quot; You are like the worst vulnerability role model ever . &quot; And then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic , but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic .
And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learnt something hard about myself , and that was that , as much as I would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world , there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small , staying right under the radar .
It is the best way to shut people down on an airplane .
And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I didn &apos;t mess it up here .
I can bring home the bacon , fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you are a man . For women , shame is do it all , do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat .
So the question is : how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical ?
It is also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock , it stands .
How do we calm it down ?
Can we put this off till 2020 , 2030 , 2050 ?
The wackiest plan -- and I am not making this up -- would put what is essentially a garden hose 18-and-a-half miles high into the sky , suspended by balloons , to spew sulfur dioxide .
BF : You know , sometimes when people do those , they go all the way down .
DH : Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage ?
And hand it off to the nurse . She squirts it into a tin .
So now what we do is we take a genome , we make maybe 50 copies of it , we cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads , and then we sequence them , massively parallel .
Now , after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high , he would tell us that our question was completely stupid .
When we introduce a new direction , we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction , and then we can rotate it in with the others .
But in science , if something isn &apos;t working , you have to toss it out and try something else .
I am going to let you in on that secret .
We &apos;ve got to go out there and clean this thing up .
I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so , I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world , and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture .
It is very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle or a glass bottle , if you are travelling and you &apos;ve forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water , versus purchasing plastic bottled water .
You just scoop the water up .
She picks the water up from there , desalinates it , for free , transports it over there , and dumps it onto the mountains , rivers , and streams .
Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years .
And every time they turn themselves over there is some damage . And that damage builds up .
Typically in America we &apos;ve divided our adult life up into two sections .
And we managed to boil it down to nine .
We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center , up inside the NASA vehicle , into the back of the zero-g airplane .
And I refused to give them up ,
If you are not pregnant , you can take a loan out from us . And that was run by them .
He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot .
And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets -- everywhere , everywhere .
I don &apos;t make them up . There is no need for that .
I know them well .
The day before , her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him . millions of women live like this today .
The poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down .
The trick is to join them up , to use food as a way of seeing .
And it is not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down .
but I did finally figure it out . I had to figure it out , because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector ,
Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways .
He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring , and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building , apartment by apartment , checking every television , checking every connection , hoping to find out what this problem is .
I could take you down one of those narrow little streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold --
and all the pigeons , a la Red Balloon , are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city .
And I forgot to mention this : whenever he lost a pigeon , he would take that pigeon out beyond the walls of the city .
and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction .
Can we really scale this up ? Can we really embed robotics into every part ?
What I am going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we are about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves .
But if we can find ways to give more choices to both , that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps .
And they soon adopted rules which slowed down innovation and cut China off from the rest of the world .
If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth .
You wouldn &apos;t let academics out in the wild .
makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there .
And then , if we put them back in the environment , generally they are quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was .
And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people .
